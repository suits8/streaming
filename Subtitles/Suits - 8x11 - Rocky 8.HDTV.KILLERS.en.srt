1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,312
<i>Previously, on</i>
"SUITS"...

2
00:00:01,393 --> 00:00:03,414
Two conflict of interest
waivers giving you

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,501
the green light to take off
the gloves, get in the ring.

4
00:00:05,586 --> 00:00:07,169
You gonna let him
push us around like that?

5
00:00:07,254 --> 00:00:09,041
We go to court,
I will clean your clock.

6
00:00:09,127 --> 00:00:09,876
Bring it on.

7
00:00:09,962 --> 00:00:11,882
And this is between you and me,
not Jessica.

8
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:13,430
She admitted to being
a party to fraud

9
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:15,530
- in front of the State Bar.
- Son of a bitch.

10
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,762
Ah, that's the look
I came here to see.

11
00:00:17,848 --> 00:00:19,843
Only thing better would be
if I were there

12
00:00:19,944 --> 00:00:21,115
when you have
to tell Jessica Pearson

13
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:23,227
that you cost her
her license to practice off.

14
00:00:23,312 --> 00:00:26,687
Harvey basically asked me to
impersonate Samantha Wheeler.

15
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:28,882
If Harvey wants you to do that,
why not do it?

16
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:31,304
Other than not wanting to get
on Samantha's bad side,

17
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,382
Louis said if too many
people got involved,

18
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:35,072
their fight could tear
the firm apart.

19
00:00:35,157 --> 00:00:37,324
I got proof the packing company
skimped on materials

20
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:39,785
- and your client knew about it.
- God damn it! Robert.

21
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,454
What is it gonna take for you
to get off the sidelines?

22
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:44,921
Robert's about to tell Harvey
he'll put up Samantha's name

23
00:00:45,007 --> 00:00:46,469
instead of Alex.
We don't do something,

24
00:00:46,554 --> 00:00:48,452
we won't have a firm.
We'll have a war.

25
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:50,452
Harvey and Robert
would never vote

26
00:00:50,538 --> 00:00:51,640
to make me
Managing Partner.

27
00:00:51,726 --> 00:00:52,734
You leave that to me.

28
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,563
Think you have what it takes
to run this firm?

29
00:00:54,648 --> 00:00:56,648
I know I do.
My first order of business

30
00:00:56,734 --> 00:00:58,624
is promoting Alex and Samantha
at the same time.

31
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,687
So, what's it gonna be?
A split decision,

32
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:02,812
or are we gonna make
this unanimous?

33
00:01:09,343 --> 00:01:11,442
Good morning, Harvey.
Coffee?

34
00:01:11,577 --> 00:01:13,362
Don't mind if I do.

35
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:15,487
Donna,
this coffee's cold.

36
00:01:15,572 --> 00:01:17,573
Well, it was hot
two hours ago.

37
00:01:17,658 --> 00:01:20,034
Harvey, how could you oversleep
today of all days?

38
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:22,327
I'll tell you how.
I had a nightmare last night

39
00:01:22,412 --> 00:01:24,120
that we made Louis
Managing Partner,

40
00:01:24,205 --> 00:01:25,790
and I couldn't
get back to sleep.

41
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,332
Wasn't a nightmare.
You know it.

42
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:29,773
Instead of showing up late,
what you should be doing

43
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:31,712
is ask Louis how you can
make life easier.

44
00:01:31,797 --> 00:01:33,226
Well. What I'm gonna be doing

45
00:01:33,312 --> 00:01:34,890
is kicking the shit
out of Andy Malik.

46
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,383
- What?
- I didn't oversleep.

47
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:38,469
I spent the morning
digging into an article

48
00:01:38,554 --> 00:01:40,054
about Malik's
newest client.

49
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:43,218
So you're gonna represent
the guy he's going after

50
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:44,433
to make him pay
for Jessica.

51
00:01:44,518 --> 00:01:46,979
- Exactly.
- Harvey...

52
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:49,312
No one would
appreciate you

53
00:01:49,398 --> 00:01:51,319
knocking down Andrew Malik
more than me,

54
00:01:51,882 --> 00:01:54,276
but is day one of Louis' reign
the best time?

55
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:56,710
It's the perfect time.
In fact, I'm doing him a favor

56
00:01:56,796 --> 00:01:58,461
by letting him figure out
how he wants to run

57
00:01:58,546 --> 00:02:00,241
this place
in his own unique way.

58
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:02,493
- In other words, you're ducking him.
- Yup, that's what I said.

59
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:04,703
So, what do you say
you help me out with Malik?

60
00:02:04,788 --> 00:02:07,452
Let me guess, by getting you
a hot cup of coffee?

61
00:02:07,538 --> 00:02:10,085
It's like you never left.
Do you mind?

62
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:11,358
Of course not.

63
00:02:11,585 --> 00:02:13,389
There's this little thing
called a kitchen.

64
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:15,256
Just walk down the hall
past reception

65
00:02:15,342 --> 00:02:17,414
and take a left at
"I've never heated up your coffee"

66
00:02:17,499 --> 00:02:19,374
and I'm not about
to start now."

67
00:02:19,803 --> 00:02:21,342
So that's a no.

68
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:26,308
Excuse me, handsome.

69
00:02:26,585 --> 00:02:27,710
Have you heard the news?

70
00:02:27,796 --> 00:02:29,491
<i>Why, no, Louis, I haven't.
What news?</i>

71
00:02:29,577 --> 00:02:31,303
Helo! No biggie,
you're just looking at

72
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:32,765
the newest Managing Partner
in the city.

73
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,006
<i>Get out of town!</i>

74
00:02:34,092 --> 00:02:35,327
<i>Saul and Naomi's kid?</i>

75
00:02:35,413 --> 00:02:37,820
That's right, baby girl.
The very one.

76
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:39,363
<i>Ooh-ha!</i>

77
00:02:39,448 --> 00:02:42,341
<i>Look at the newest
Managing Partner in the city!</i>

78
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:43,951
You talkin' to me?

79
00:02:44,036 --> 00:02:45,677
<i>I'm the only one here.</i>

80
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:47,371
Then all I gotta say is...

81
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:48,456
<i>Let's go.</i>

82
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:54,700
<i>♪ Ooh, I'm a rebel
Just for kicks, now ♪</i>

83
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:57,381
<i>♪ I been feeling it
Since 1966, now ♪</i>

84
00:02:57,466 --> 00:03:01,845
<i>♪ Might be over now
But I feel it still ♪</i>

85
00:03:03,723 --> 00:03:06,747
<i>♪ Ooh, I'm a rebel
Just for kicks, now ♪</i>

86
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,809
<i>♪ Let me kick it
Like it's 1986, now ♪</i>

87
00:03:09,895 --> 00:03:12,833
<i>♪ Might be over now
But I feel it still ♪</i>

88
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:16,138
<i>♪ Might've had your fill
But I feel it still ♪</i>

89
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,419
- Gretchen.
- Louis.

90
00:03:18,552 --> 00:03:20,217
Don't tell me you've been
walking through the place

91
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:21,856
like you own it,
doing God knows what

92
00:03:21,942 --> 00:03:24,033
- to everybody you see.
- Not walking, strutting,

93
00:03:24,118 --> 00:03:25,669
and high-fiving,
fist-bumping,

94
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:26,856
and a bit of this:

95
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:29,145
As you should,
Mr. Managing-Partner.

96
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:31,729
That's what I'm say...
Don't even think about it.

97
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:34,459
- Think about what?
- All right, Louis, two things.

98
00:03:34,544 --> 00:03:36,731
Congratulations
and I'm proud of you,

99
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,672
- and I'm gonna need a raise.
- That's three things.

100
00:03:38,757 --> 00:03:41,175
"Congratulations, I'm proud of
you" is the same thing.

101
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,886
Another thing, I will no
longer be getting your coffee,

102
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:46,097
get your car washed,
or trim your neck hair.

103
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:48,015
Gretchen! You've never done
any of those things.

104
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,808
And I never will.

105
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:51,936
You're just giving me shit,
aren't you?

106
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:53,755
Mm-hmm.

107
00:03:54,113 --> 00:03:56,530
Louis, I don't need
a plug nickel.

108
00:03:57,692 --> 00:03:59,185
I was here for you before.

109
00:03:59,278 --> 00:04:01,130
I'm here with you now,
whatever you need.

110
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:02,905
Thank you, Gretchen,

111
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:04,740
and all I need
is for people to know

112
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:06,645
that there may be
a new person at the top,

113
00:04:06,952 --> 00:04:09,466
but I want this firm to be
the same as it ever was.

114
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,168
Now, move those feet.
Come on, now!

115
00:04:16,253 --> 00:04:17,669
Jim Allen.

116
00:04:17,754 --> 00:04:19,588
Yeah, that's right.
Who are you?

117
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:21,590
I'm the guy
that's gonna win your case

118
00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:23,138
against Andrew Malik.

119
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:26,239
That's funny, 'cause I
already got a guy to do that.

120
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:28,669
You have a guy who says he can,
but you should know

121
00:04:28,755 --> 00:04:30,279
that just because a guy
talks a big game

122
00:04:30,364 --> 00:04:32,153
doesn't mean
he won't get knocked out.

123
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,950
Why should I believe you can
handle this if my guy can't?

124
00:04:35,036 --> 00:04:37,350
- You seen Rocky IV?
- Only about 30 times.

125
00:04:37,482 --> 00:04:39,441
Well, Malik's Ivan Drago,

126
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:41,235
and my old mentor
is Apollo Creed.

127
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,294
Let me guess,
you're Rocky.

128
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:46,907
I'm Rocky, Clubber Lang,
and Apollo all rolled into one

129
00:04:46,992 --> 00:04:49,910
because Malik took a swing
at people I care about.

130
00:04:49,995 --> 00:04:52,079
- He knocked one out.
- And nobody fights harder

131
00:04:52,164 --> 00:04:53,831
than someone looking
for payback.

132
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,124
And on top of all of that,

133
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:57,375
I'm the best there is
on a bad day.

134
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,546
So are you in?

135
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:01,297
I'm in.

136
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:03,559
Then the only thing left
for me to ask is,

137
00:05:03,645 --> 00:05:05,217
is there anything
you need to tell me?

138
00:05:05,302 --> 00:05:07,344
You mean did I
throw that fight?

139
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:10,181
You listen to me.
I love this sport.

140
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:11,890
I'd never do anything
to hurt it,

141
00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:13,084
and if you don't believe me,

142
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:15,130
you can march
that fancy suit out right now.

143
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:16,854
I just needed
to hear you say it.

144
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:18,605
For the record,
I saw the fight.

145
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,025
Alonzo caught him dead-on.

146
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,943
Might be
a once-in-a-lifetime shot,

147
00:05:23,028 --> 00:05:25,216
but there's no way Ricky
faked going down.

148
00:05:25,302 --> 00:05:26,702
Then why don't you
stop telling me

149
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:28,080
something I already know

150
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:29,700
and go out there
and prove it?

151
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:31,576
'Cause I gotta go fire
my old lawyer.

152
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:34,731
Trust me, it'll go a lot
smoother once you told him

153
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:36,623
that the man
who's taking his place

154
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,067

Robert.

165
00:06:15,962 --> 00:06:18,129
Well, it's official.

166
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,382
I just signed over
the management of the firm

167
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:21,966
- to Louis this morning.
- And?

168
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:23,218
Well, I gotta say,

169
00:06:23,303 --> 00:06:25,095
it's a weight lifted off
my shoulders.

170
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,463
Doesn't look like
a weight off.

171
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:29,098
Oh! You seriously gonna
say that to me today or all days?

172
00:06:29,184 --> 00:06:30,975
Yeah. That's how strong
I think our bond is.

173
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,689
Are you sure?
Because I can make fun

174
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:33,933
of your
physical appearance too.

175
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,666
Really?
Huh, what would you say?

176
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:38,291
Never mind.

177
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:40,318
Listen, I heard
that you're taking on

178
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:42,279
that, uh,
fixed fight case.

179
00:06:42,364 --> 00:06:43,736
I want in.
Robert...

180
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:45,533
Ah, no buts, Harvey.
I know.

181
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:48,314
Jessica was your mentor,
but she was also my friend.

182
00:06:48,787 --> 00:06:52,314
And not to mention, after
15 years as Managing Partner,

183
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:54,874
I'm dying to step back
in that ring.

184
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,268
I get it, you don't want to be
ordered around by Louis, either.

185
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,299
The man walks into
my office this morning

186
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:02,633
and asks me about turning
the bathrooms coed.

187
00:07:02,718 --> 00:07:05,197
Look at me. Do I look like
I want coed bathrooms?

188
00:07:05,886 --> 00:07:08,166
All right, you're in.

189
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,582
But let's be clear.

190
00:07:09,808 --> 00:07:11,510
This isn't about
avoiding Louis.

191
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:13,697
This is about handing
Andrew Malik

192
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:16,285
a big, fat public knockout.

193
00:07:16,962 --> 00:07:18,015
What do you think?

194
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:19,691
I think that is something

195
00:07:19,776 --> 00:07:21,485
I've waited
a long time to see.

196
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,119
You have no idea.

197
00:07:23,374 --> 00:07:25,088
And what with
you overcoming

198
00:07:25,174 --> 00:07:26,657
the difficulties
of being white,

199
00:07:26,838 --> 00:07:28,471
you must've thought
you'd never make it.

200
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,174
And you having to deal with
the struggles of being a man.

201
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:33,789
It's a triumph
of the human spirit.

202
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:34,790
Mm.

203
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,166
I have to say,
I'm surprised

204
00:07:36,251 --> 00:07:37,668
you went with
Wheeler Williams.

205
00:07:37,753 --> 00:07:39,043
Well, I thought about it,

206
00:07:39,128 --> 00:07:41,045
and a name in the middle
might get lost,

207
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,588
but a last name
sticks with people.

208
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:45,752
Has more power to it.

209
00:07:46,344 --> 00:07:47,807
Sure.

210
00:07:48,137 --> 00:07:49,572
Like Tonto,

211
00:07:49,972 --> 00:07:51,393
Robin,

212
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:53,228
Garfunkel.

213
00:07:53,643 --> 00:07:56,394
Shit, I may need
to rethink this.

214
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,400
While you're thinking about it,
how'd you do it?

215
00:07:58,634 --> 00:08:00,009
- Do what?
- You know what.

216
00:08:00,275 --> 00:08:01,566
Get that evidence.

217
00:08:01,651 --> 00:08:03,443
Samantha,
you made name partner.

218
00:08:03,528 --> 00:08:04,736
I made name partner.

219
00:08:04,822 --> 00:08:06,070
Don't let something
eat you up

220
00:08:06,155 --> 00:08:07,463
that doesn't
even matter anymore.

221
00:08:07,705 --> 00:08:08,830
Let it go.

222
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,623
Thomas, Gretchen said
you were here.

223
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,636
- You hear the news?
- I certainly did.

224
00:08:18,768 --> 00:08:20,084
Wish I was here
to congratulate you,

225
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:22,086
but I've got a problem,
Louis.

226
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:23,590
I had to fire Larry.

227
00:08:23,707 --> 00:08:25,082
What?

228
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,697
- Why? He's been with you forever.
- Oh, I know that.

229
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:30,533
We signed this deal with
Winthrop Hotels. He let them

230
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:32,853
slip something into the fine
print about volume discounts.

231
00:08:32,938 --> 00:08:35,377
I fulfill this order,
I go out of business.

232
00:08:35,463 --> 00:08:37,401
And if you don't, they sue you
for breach of contract.

233
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:38,675
Sure, that is
a fireable offense.

234
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,713
I need you to get me
out of that contract.

235
00:08:42,358 --> 00:08:43,822
Of course.
I'll take care of it.

236
00:08:44,402 --> 00:08:46,518
One more thing,
I'm, uh...

237
00:08:46,939 --> 00:08:49,361
I'm gonna need
an interim General Counsel.

238
00:08:50,049 --> 00:08:51,714
Well, look, you know
I want to say yes, but...

239
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,353
Louis, I need this,

240
00:08:53,588 --> 00:08:55,620
just until
I find somebody else.

241
00:08:56,054 --> 00:08:58,101
Okay, I will handle things
for you in the interim,

242
00:08:58,211 --> 00:08:59,524
and we'll find you
a new General Counsel.

243
00:08:59,609 --> 00:09:00,900
Thank you, my friend.

244
00:09:01,098 --> 00:09:02,593
Knew I could count on you.

245
00:09:08,885 --> 00:09:10,843
Nina,
what are you doing here?

246
00:09:10,992 --> 00:09:13,211
I came by to say
it's not gonna look very good

247
00:09:13,297 --> 00:09:14,899
if the same day your name
gets on the wall,

248
00:09:14,984 --> 00:09:16,289
you lose
a billion-dollar client.

249
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,975
- What?
- Don't "what" me.

250
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,906
We lost $80 million,
and I want my money back.

251
00:09:20,992 --> 00:09:23,039
I'm a lawyer,
not a miracle worker.

252
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,118
Unless you want the ethics board
looking into what you did,

253
00:09:25,203 --> 00:09:26,953
I suggest you
become a miracle worker.

254
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,778
What do you mean,
what I did?

255
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:30,154
You know what.

256
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:32,297
You went to my Records
Department, asked for

257
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:34,476
copy of that report, and leaked it
to Alex Williams.

258
00:09:34,577 --> 00:09:36,883
Listen to me.
I never did that.

259
00:09:36,992 --> 00:09:39,497
Well, if it wasn't you, it was
someone else from your firm.

260
00:09:39,582 --> 00:09:41,321
Either way, you're gonna get me
my money back.

261
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:42,709
There's no legal way
to do that.

262
00:09:42,945 --> 00:09:44,781
You didn't have a problem
breaking the law

263
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:46,093
to lose me 80 million.

264
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:47,360
Don't tell me
you have a problem

265
00:09:47,445 --> 00:09:49,164
breaking the law
to get it back.

266
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:57,141
Harvey Specter.
What are you doing in a place

267
00:09:57,227 --> 00:09:58,656
where people
with integrity work?

268
00:09:58,742 --> 00:10:00,602
I came to tell you
you should've stayed down

269
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:02,270
after I knocked you out
last time,

270
00:10:02,355 --> 00:10:04,272
because I'm representing
Jim Allen.

271
00:10:04,422 --> 00:10:05,657
Oh, what a surprise
that you would

272
00:10:05,742 --> 00:10:07,325
step into the ring
with a fraud.

273
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:08,761
Hey, speaking of frauds, uh,

274
00:10:08,847 --> 00:10:11,031
how's Jessica enjoying
the Windy City?

275
00:10:11,117 --> 00:10:13,430
She's doing just fine,
but you're about to get

276
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:14,491
what's coming to you.

277
00:10:14,576 --> 00:10:15,860
Then you picked
the wrong case,

278
00:10:15,946 --> 00:10:18,016
because there's no way
a fighter in his prime

279
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,602
loses to
a middle-aged has-been.

280
00:10:19,688 --> 00:10:21,229
And upsets happen
all the time.

281
00:10:21,315 --> 00:10:24,729
Broadway Joe, Miracle on Ice,
Eagles-Patriots last year.

282
00:10:24,815 --> 00:10:27,196
What, you think
they were all crooked?

283
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:29,297
Team sports, asshole.

284
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:31,727
The easiest game in the world
to fix is boxing,

285
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:32,812
and everybody knows it.

286
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,481
So defend him
all you want,

287
00:10:34,637 --> 00:10:35,929
but I'm not backing down.

288
00:10:36,014 --> 00:10:37,079
I don't think
you understand.

289
00:10:37,164 --> 00:10:39,498
I'm not just defending him.
I'm coming after you.

290
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:42,578
Because you'd rather trump up
a case against a promoter

291
00:10:42,664 --> 00:10:44,038
than go after
a real criminal.

292
00:10:44,124 --> 00:10:45,758
Jim Allen
is a real criminal.

293
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:47,305
He is staining a sport
that I love.

294
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:49,071
I'm not gonna
let him get away with it.

295
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,500
You love boxing?

296
00:10:50,624 --> 00:10:52,367
Middleweight champ,
Eastern Long Island

297
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:53,743
two years in a row.

298
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:55,672
Then what do you say
we lace 'em up

299
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:56,883
and settle this in the ring?

300
00:10:56,969 --> 00:10:58,999
Spoken like a lawyer with
a guilty man for a client.

301
00:10:59,084 --> 00:11:01,813
Spoken like someone who's
as afraid of me in the gym

302
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:03,483
as he should be
in the courtroom.

303
00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:04,652
You finished?

304
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:07,055
No. But you are.

305
00:11:07,503 --> 00:11:09,235
You just
don't know it yet.

306
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,203
Louis, what are you doing?
Are you hiding in here?

307
00:11:16,304 --> 00:11:18,360
I am working on something.

308
00:11:19,099 --> 00:11:21,492
Is that something doing work
for Thomas Kessler

309
00:11:21,578 --> 00:11:23,685
that should've been farmed out
to someone else?

310
00:11:24,004 --> 00:11:25,603
Donna, he's one
of my oldest clients.

311
00:11:25,688 --> 00:11:26,817
He lost his general counsel.

312
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:27,871
I'm not hanging him
out to dry.

313
00:11:27,957 --> 00:11:30,715
I'm not saying you should.
I'm saying delegate.

314
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,570
I got a stack of things
you haven't even looked at yet.

315
00:11:33,655 --> 00:11:35,154
You handle them.
You're the COO.

316
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:37,512
I can't.
The bylaws explicitly state

317
00:11:37,598 --> 00:11:39,242
they're the purview
of the Managing Partner.

318
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:40,293
Who the hell decided that?

319
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:41,942
You did, when you
put it in the bylaws.

320
00:11:42,027 --> 00:11:43,326
That the purview
of the managing Partner,

321
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,829
Donna, I cannot let
my clients down.

322
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:47,020
It is just not in me.

323
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,254
You wouldn't be. You'd be
giving him to someone

324
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,537
who can handle him
more closely.

325
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:52,177
What about finding
placement in a general counsel?

326
00:11:52,262 --> 00:11:54,083
- Who's gonna do that?
- Louis, I just found us

327
00:11:54,168 --> 00:11:55,646
a new Managing Partner.
I think, I can handle

328
00:11:55,731 --> 00:11:58,106
finding Thomas Kessler
a new general counsel.

329
00:11:58,192 --> 00:11:59,858
Now, the better question is,

330
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:02,641
can you handle this job
that you agreed to take?

331
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:15,700
"Great
leadership is when leaders believe

332
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:18,512
"in the greatness
in those below them

333
00:12:19,508 --> 00:12:23,254
and to the side of them,
delegating greatly... ".

334
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,309
Are you having a stroke?

335
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:25,418
I'm quoting Churchill.

336
00:12:25,504 --> 00:12:27,302
Really? It sounds like
you're quoting yourself.

337
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:28,590
Churchill, me,
same difference.

338
00:12:28,676 --> 00:12:31,020
The point is,
is that Thomas Kessler

339
00:12:31,106 --> 00:12:33,064
has a contract that
he needs to get out of that.

340
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,442
And you are
the man for the job.

341
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:35,944
Donna told you to delegate?

342
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,817
No, not... Maybe.
Yeah, she did.

343
00:12:37,903 --> 00:12:38,903
The truth is,

344
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:40,879
you are the best man
for the job,

345
00:12:40,965 --> 00:12:42,041
with the exception of me.

346
00:12:42,127 --> 00:12:43,261
If you don't want
to give me the...

347
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,776
The reason I think
I'm better is,

348
00:12:44,862 --> 00:12:47,080
Thomas Kessler is one of my
oldest clients.

349
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:49,105
We don't get him out of this,
he goes out of business.

350
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,643
If it were me,
there is nothing

351
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,377
I wouldn't do
to keep that from happening.

352
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:55,799
Louis, I hear you loud and clear.
I don't care what it takes.

353
00:12:55,885 --> 00:12:57,541
This man is not going
out of business.

354
00:12:57,627 --> 00:12:58,877
Thank you, Alex.

355
00:13:07,214 --> 00:13:08,797
Can I help you?

356
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:11,042
Yes, I'm looking
for Thomas Kessler.

357
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:13,760
Congratulations,
you found him.

358
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,330
Oh.

359
00:13:15,722 --> 00:13:18,018
I'm Donna Paulsen.
I'm from Zane Specter...

360
00:13:18,104 --> 00:13:19,850
No, I know who you are.

361
00:13:20,205 --> 00:13:21,666
What can
I do for you, Donna?

362
00:13:21,752 --> 00:13:23,353
Actually, I'm here
to do something for you.

363
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:25,105
I'll find you
a new general counsel.

364
00:13:25,283 --> 00:13:26,557
I appreciate
the offer,

365
00:13:26,643 --> 00:13:28,853
but I've already got
Korn Ferry working on that.

366
00:13:28,985 --> 00:13:31,369
And Louis Litt wants to make sure
you feel taken care of.

367
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:32,822
It's my job to see
that happens.

368
00:13:32,908 --> 00:13:34,366
No offense,
but they're the best

369
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,065
headhunters
in the world.

370
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:37,486
What can you do
that they can't?

371
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:38,784
Tell you what.
I'm gonna get you

372
00:13:38,869 --> 00:13:40,580
the top 10 candidates
by tomorrow.

373
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:43,290
And trust me. When I'm done,
you're gonna want to hire me.

374
00:13:43,494 --> 00:13:45,722
Bold statement from someone
who doesn't know my business.

375
00:13:45,807 --> 00:13:47,627
Well, I can't design
a lampshade

376
00:13:47,713 --> 00:13:49,705
if that's what you're
getting at, but I do know

377
00:13:49,815 --> 00:13:51,798
40 percent of your business
is commercial

378
00:13:51,883 --> 00:13:54,009
and you passed on
a buyout last year

379
00:13:54,094 --> 00:13:56,494
because you wanted to pursue
this hotel deal,

380
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,643
which is why you are now

381
00:13:57,729 --> 00:13:59,283
looking for
a new general counsel.

382
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:00,766
I guess you do know
my business.

383
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,557
And for the record,
I can design a lampshade too.

384
00:14:04,565 --> 00:14:06,275
But finding you
the right general counsel

385
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:08,232
isn't just about
knowing your business.

386
00:14:08,317 --> 00:14:09,994
No, it's about chemistry.

387
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,033
- Yes, it is.
- Mm-hmm.

388
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:13,445
How do you know my type?

389
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,405
Well, let's see.

390
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:17,409
You're wearing a suit
that's just nice enough

391
00:14:17,494 --> 00:14:20,079
to hide the fact that
you don't care about the suit,

392
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:21,815
and you don't care about it

393
00:14:21,901 --> 00:14:23,538
because you don't want
your employees

394
00:14:23,623 --> 00:14:24,776
thinking you're above them,

395
00:14:24,862 --> 00:14:26,541
which means you do
care about the suit.

396
00:14:26,627 --> 00:14:29,455
But what you care about
even more is your people.

397
00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:32,354
You're saying my suit
looks cheap?

398
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,627
I am saying it looks
sharp as hell,

399
00:14:34,713 --> 00:14:37,666
but I'm also saying
that you are a CEO

400
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,791
who needs a GC
who understands your POV.

401
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:41,244
Yes, I D-O-O.

402
00:14:41,408 --> 00:14:42,432
That didn't come out right.

403
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:43,976
Points for trying.

404
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:48,158
So Thomas,
do I have the job or not?

405
00:14:48,526 --> 00:14:51,408
Well, listen, if Louis
wants me to be taken care of,

406
00:14:51,735 --> 00:14:52,815
then who am I to say...

407
00:14:52,912 --> 00:14:55,166
I'll have the candidates
for you by tomorrow.

408
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:02,213
I would've thought,
given your time at Rand Kaldor,

409
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:03,894
you would've learned better
than to tangle with me.

410
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:06,396
I did. I have no intention
of tangling with you.

411
00:15:06,482 --> 00:15:08,148
Then let me
tell you a story.

412
00:15:08,494 --> 00:15:10,744
I just lost a huge case
for my client.

413
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:13,127
Dexhart. I like to think
of my client as Nina

414
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,940
because that's the woman
I have always been loyal to.

415
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,611
So when Nina accused me
of betraying her,

416
00:15:18,697 --> 00:15:19,861
I knew something was wrong.

417
00:15:19,947 --> 00:15:23,389
Turns out, a blonde woman
came in asking for their files.

418
00:15:23,474 --> 00:15:26,643
She didn't say her name, just
that she was a senior partner.

419
00:15:26,728 --> 00:15:28,187
Samantha...
It was a smart move,

420
00:15:28,272 --> 00:15:29,604
because it didn't
break the law,

421
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,107
but it was also dumb,

422
00:15:31,336 --> 00:15:34,378
because it wasn't hard
to figure out who it was.

423
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,145
I know what
you're thinking.

424
00:15:36,722 --> 00:15:39,237
You didn't do this on your own.
You were given an order.

425
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:41,057
If you think
I'm going to tell you

426
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:42,716
who gave me that order...
I don't care who gave it.

427
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:44,593
What I care about is
now you're going

428
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,292
to take an order
from me.

429
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,669
What are you
talking about?

430
00:15:47,755 --> 00:15:50,206
Your client Kappa Financial
is negotiating

431
00:15:50,331 --> 00:15:52,669
a $70-million settlement
with the SEC

432
00:15:52,754 --> 00:15:54,893
that Dexhart
is on the hook for.

433
00:15:55,097 --> 00:15:56,422
You're gonna get them
off the hook

434
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,542
by getting Kappa
to admit fault.

435
00:15:58,628 --> 00:16:00,152
- They'll never do that.
- I guess someone's

436
00:16:00,237 --> 00:16:02,804
gonna have to slip it into
the deal without them noticing.

437
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:04,973
You said it,
I didn't break the law.

438
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:06,503
There's nothing
you can do to me.

439
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:07,714
You said it yourself,

440
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,463
you didn't want
to tangle with me.

441
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:11,331
If you think
I can't find something

442
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:14,018
where you did cross the line,

443
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:17,643
well, then you haven't
been paying attention.

444
00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:22,440
All right. I understand we're here
because of a motion to dismiss?

445
00:16:22,526 --> 00:16:23,675
That's right, Your Honor.

446
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:26,328
He has no proof my client
ever defrauded anyone.

447
00:16:26,413 --> 00:16:29,248
Never? What would you call
rigging a scale before a fight?

448
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,624
If you're talking about
the Watkins-Lopez fight,

449
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:33,293
that was 15 years ago,

450
00:16:33,378 --> 00:16:36,464
and Omar Watkins was a kid
that made a five-pound mistake.

451
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,854
Or Jim Allen's a promoter
who let an overweight fighter

452
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,112
break the rules and then paid
him $50,000 to lie about it.

453
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:45,011
Alonzo, I'm Robert Zane.

454
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,099
Been a fan for a long time.
Have a seat.

455
00:16:47,184 --> 00:16:49,517
I'll have a seat, but let me
save you some time.

456
00:16:49,602 --> 00:16:50,831
Ricky didn't take a dive.

457
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:52,093
You sound pretty sure.

458
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,471
I'm sure because I felt
my glove smash his face.

459
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:56,050
Defense is right,
Mr. Malik.

460
00:16:56,176 --> 00:16:58,802
Circumstantial evidence
from 15 years ago isn't enough.

461
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:01,987
How about the fact a huge bet
was placed before this fight?

462
00:17:02,073 --> 00:17:04,324
A lot of bets were placed
before this fight.

463
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:06,993
Not $100,000 on the underdog
at the last second.

464
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:08,925
You know everybody
counted me out?

465
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:11,705
Now the only thing
they're counting to is 2: 10

466
00:17:11,862 --> 00:17:14,459
because I dropped that chump,
plain and simple.

467
00:17:14,544 --> 00:17:16,448
$100,000?
That's right, Your Honor.

468
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:18,213
All in increments
of $9900.

469
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:21,198
Increments? Then you don't know
it was the same person at all.

470
00:17:21,284 --> 00:17:23,913
Not to mention
the fact that $9900

471
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:25,845
is under the legal
reporting requirements.

472
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,663
By $100, which is awfully
convenient if you're trying to

473
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:31,601
break the law and not draw
attention to it, like Jim Allen did.

474
00:17:31,686 --> 00:17:33,085
Jim Allen's not dirty.

475
00:17:33,271 --> 00:17:35,241
I don't care
what that lawyer says.

476
00:17:35,327 --> 00:17:36,576
I didn't take a dive.

477
00:17:36,729 --> 00:17:38,063
I'll tell you
something else.

478
00:17:38,149 --> 00:17:40,234
I get a rematch
with that piece of shit,

479
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,187
I'm gonna drop him
like a stone.

480
00:17:42,445 --> 00:17:44,687
The fact is, you only found
something suspicious

481
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:47,274
- by doing something suspicious.
- I was doing my job.

482
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,660
Your job isn't to look
at bets under $10,000.

483
00:17:49,746 --> 00:17:51,234
I'll look
at whatever I want.

484
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,831
When I find out
who made those bets,

485
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,666
I'll have your fraudulent
client dead to rights.

486
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:57,461
That's enough. The evidence
is sufficient to move forward.

487
00:17:57,547 --> 00:17:59,505
Your Honor...
Enough, Mr. Specter.

488
00:17:59,797 --> 00:18:01,773
This case is going to trial.

489
00:18:09,531 --> 00:18:10,773
I'm guessing
by that look,

490
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:12,650
- we're going to trial.
- We are.

491
00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:14,030
The judge denied our motion

492
00:18:14,116 --> 00:18:15,851
because Malik
made Jim look guilty.

493
00:18:15,937 --> 00:18:17,492
- You think he is?
- No.

494
00:18:17,578 --> 00:18:19,655
He looked me in the eye,
told me he was innocent,

495
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:20,713
and I believe him.

496
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,841
I feel the same way
about those fighters.

497
00:18:23,175 --> 00:18:24,926
Well, the next thing
we need to do...

498
00:18:25,011 --> 00:18:26,386
Harvey, the next thing
we need to do

499
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:28,430
is tell Louis
what's going on.

500
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:31,226
If there's any chance
that we could lose this thing,

501
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:32,749
he deserves to know.

502
00:18:32,835 --> 00:18:35,249
I tell him that, he's gonna
tell me to drop this thing,

503
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:36,686
which I am not gonna do.

504
00:18:36,772 --> 00:18:38,230
How is that
gonna make him feel?

505
00:18:38,386 --> 00:18:40,257
I'll tell you how,
like a Managing Partner,

506
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:42,796
because Louis is
running this firm now.

507
00:18:43,085 --> 00:18:45,569
And we need to respect him
enough to tell him to his face.

508
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:48,554
So if you're not gonna tell him
what's going on with this...

509
00:18:49,451 --> 00:18:50,921
I will.

510
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:53,194
All right, I'll tell him.

511
00:18:55,499 --> 00:18:57,229
Louis, can I talk to you
for a second?

512
00:18:57,315 --> 00:18:58,606
Yeah, of course, Harvey.

513
00:18:58,692 --> 00:18:59,988
You know my door's always
open to you.

514
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:01,136
Good.

515
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:04,377
Robert and I are taking a case
that you might not like,

516
00:19:04,462 --> 00:19:05,942
and since
you're Managing Partner now.

517
00:19:06,027 --> 00:19:07,620
Harvey, let me stop you
right there.

518
00:19:07,728 --> 00:19:08,853
Already?

519
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,730
Yeah, I don't need
to hear any more.

520
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:12,141
Good luck with your case.

521
00:19:12,227 --> 00:19:13,853
You don't want
to hear what it is

522
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:15,901
before saying you're good
with me taking it?

523
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:18,237
No, I know. Because you're good
with you taking it.

524
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:21,042
Louis, if this is
some kind of Jedi mind trick

525
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:22,502
that Lipschitz
taught you...

526
00:19:22,588 --> 00:19:23,793
I don't know
who Jed Mindtrick is,

527
00:19:23,878 --> 00:19:27,026
but I do know I intend to be
the world's best delegator.

528
00:19:27,191 --> 00:19:28,770
If I'm gonna do that,
there's no way I can

529
00:19:28,855 --> 00:19:30,659
- try to tame you.
- In that case...

530
00:19:30,745 --> 00:19:32,362
I definitely can't
put a saddle on you,

531
00:19:32,448 --> 00:19:34,365
much less try
to ride you bareback.

532
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:35,800
Ride me what, now?

533
00:19:35,886 --> 00:19:37,222
Bareback.

534
00:19:37,346 --> 00:19:40,261
I said, ride you bareback.

535
00:19:40,517 --> 00:19:41,737
Please don't...

536
00:19:42,176 --> 00:19:43,362
don't say "bareback" again.

537
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:44,470
Why not?

538
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:45,973
Harvey...

539
00:19:49,207 --> 00:19:50,769
Listen to me.

540
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:53,316
You are a wild stallion,

541
00:19:54,053 --> 00:19:56,644
and wild stallions
have to run free.

542
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,355
Louis, I'm really
not comfortable

543
00:19:58,566 --> 00:20:00,151
with where this
conversation's going.

544
00:20:00,237 --> 00:20:01,675
No, no.
Shh. Shh...

545
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:07,480
All I'm saying is that
you're a magnificent steed

546
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,394
that gallops wherever
the wind takes him,

547
00:20:11,362 --> 00:20:13,097
and I'm not gonna
ride you hard

548
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,284
until, you know,
you're able to start

549
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,662
bucking underneath me.

550
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:17,870
Now, you tell me,

551
00:20:17,962 --> 00:20:19,671
how is that possibly
uncomfortable?

552
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:22,355
Nothing, Louis.
Nothing is uncomfortable.

553
00:20:22,748 --> 00:20:24,519
Then giddyup, Harvey.

554
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:26,964
Giddyup.

555
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:32,105
Hi-ya!

556
00:20:34,322 --> 00:20:36,136
Katrina,
it's after 10.

557
00:20:36,465 --> 00:20:37,757
What are you
doing in here?

558
00:20:37,873 --> 00:20:39,386
I just got promoted,
Donna.

559
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:41,387
I'm not gonna take
my foot off the gas.

560
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,987
I wouldn't expect you to.

561
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:45,581
So whose tab
are you running up?

562
00:20:46,116 --> 00:20:47,511
What?

563
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:49,427
Who's the client?

564
00:20:49,784 --> 00:20:51,011
Kappa Financial.

565
00:20:51,097 --> 00:20:53,932
I thought that settlement was
locked for closing tomorrow.

566
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:56,253
Just making some
last-minute tweaks.

567
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,214
Katrina,
what's going on?

568
00:21:01,371 --> 00:21:02,691
Why would something
be going on?

569
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:04,761
If you were just making
last-minute tweaks,

570
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,999
then either Brian
would be doing it,

571
00:21:07,085 --> 00:21:08,920
or some paralegal would.

572
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,769
Samantha wants me
to make good

573
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:13,144
on what I did for Alex.

574
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,855
You mean what Harvey
asked you to do

575
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,073
and I advised you to do
though you didn't wanna do it?

576
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:18,628
That's what I mean.

577
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:21,261
And don't tell me,
it's not exactly ethical.

578
00:21:21,495 --> 00:21:23,037
No, it's not,

579
00:21:23,123 --> 00:21:24,636
but if I do it right,

580
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,738
the worst that'll happen is,
we'll lose a client.

581
00:21:27,941 --> 00:21:29,581
If you do it wrong,
you'll get disbarred.

582
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:31,808
What difference does it make?
I don't have a choice.

583
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:34,612
It won't make any difference
if you refuse to do it.

584
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,542
Have you met
Samantha Wheeler?

585
00:21:37,515 --> 00:21:39,355
I'm not going to make
an enemy out of her.

586
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:41,567
I have met her,
and I can talk to her about...

587
00:21:41,653 --> 00:21:43,486
I don't want you
fighting my battles.

588
00:21:43,572 --> 00:21:44,905
Then fight them yourself,

589
00:21:45,252 --> 00:21:46,737
because you're
a senior partner now.

590
00:21:46,823 --> 00:21:49,026
You need to decide what
kind of lawyer you wanna be.

591
00:21:49,234 --> 00:21:52,378
I want to be the kind of
lawyer who runs her own firm.

592
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:57,089
And look at the ones who have:
Jessica, Robert, Harvey.

593
00:21:57,237 --> 00:21:59,073
They all do shit
like this.

594
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,362
Maybe they do,

595
00:22:02,003 --> 00:22:04,191
but you know what else
they all have in common?

596
00:22:05,361 --> 00:22:07,196
None of them are pushovers.

597
00:22:13,234 --> 00:22:15,296
<i>Four clean strikes in a row.</i>

598
00:22:15,382 --> 00:22:17,508
<i>Crosby doesn't look swayed.</i>

599
00:22:17,772 --> 00:22:19,476
- Talk to Louis?
- I did.

600
00:22:19,615 --> 00:22:20,882
And?

601
00:22:21,026 --> 00:22:22,921
Evidently,
I'm a wild stallion

602
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:24,124
who needs to run free.

603
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,445
We're being managed
by a crazy person.

604
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:27,601
Speaking of being managed,

605
00:22:27,687 --> 00:22:28,979
it's nice
I can count on you

606
00:22:29,065 --> 00:22:30,815
to roll up your sleeves
in my absence.

607
00:22:30,981 --> 00:22:33,189
You think I'm watching this
for my own amusement?

608
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:35,249
Don't think you're planning
on making a comeback.

609
00:22:35,335 --> 00:22:37,187
I was watching it
to see if I got played.

610
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:38,484
What are you talking about?

611
00:22:38,643 --> 00:22:41,770
All those last-minute bets
just shy of the limit.

612
00:22:41,997 --> 00:22:43,381
That couldn't have been
just coincidence,

613
00:22:43,466 --> 00:22:46,208
so I called in a favor,
got some specifics.

614
00:22:46,294 --> 00:22:47,732
You mean Samantha
called in a favor for you?

615
00:22:47,817 --> 00:22:49,473
Me, Samantha,
doesn't matter.

616
00:22:49,598 --> 00:22:51,562
I found out
who placed those bets,

617
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:54,523
and each and every one of those
people are connected to Jim.

618
00:22:54,608 --> 00:22:56,441
Robert, I looked
the man in the eye...

619
00:22:56,526 --> 00:22:57,442
Let me finish.

620
00:22:57,528 --> 00:23:00,075
The total winnings
of those long shots

621
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:02,120
was $2 million,
and we both know

622
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,798
Jim Allen would be a dumb-ass
if he risked his empire

623
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,092
for a payout that small.

624
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:07,469
And Jim Allen's no dumb-ass,

625
00:23:07,555 --> 00:23:08,934
which puts us back
to square one.

626
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,812
No, Harvey,

627
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,747
it puts us right back
in the ring.

628
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:15,084
If all of those people
are in Jim's orbit...

629
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,864
They're in Ricky Crosby's
orbit too.

630
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:18,887
It only takes one man
to throw a fight.

631
00:23:19,115 --> 00:23:20,598
You think he played you.

632
00:23:21,517 --> 00:23:23,643
I think there's
only one way to find out.

633
00:23:23,847 --> 00:23:25,512
And for the record,

634
00:23:25,793 --> 00:23:29,255
my playbook is a lot deeper
than just Samantha Wheeler.

635
00:23:29,894 --> 00:23:31,144
So she did it for you, then.

636
00:23:31,229 --> 00:23:32,938
That's exactly
what I'm saying.

637
00:23:34,364 --> 00:23:36,498
Alex, where you been?
I've been looking for you all day.

638
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,442
I'll tell you where.
I was getting screwed

639
00:23:38,528 --> 00:23:40,442
by Winthrop Hotels
and figuring out what to do about it.

640
00:23:40,527 --> 00:23:41,912
What do you mean
getting screwed by me?

641
00:23:41,997 --> 00:23:43,104
I went in there with a dozen

642
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:45,208
win-win offers, and they
shot down every one.

643
00:23:45,316 --> 00:23:47,348
- Did you threaten litigation?
- I threatened them

644
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:48,794
with everything
but the kitchen sink.

645
00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:51,348
But the fact is, this contract's airtight,
and they know it.

646
00:23:51,434 --> 00:23:52,802
What are you exactly gonna
do about it?

647
00:23:52,887 --> 00:23:54,467
Because Thomas has to honor
that contract,

648
00:23:54,552 --> 00:23:57,809
- he's out of business.
- No, Louis, he's not.

649
00:23:58,302 --> 00:23:59,434
What are you talking about?

650
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,132
I'm talking about
slicing and dicing.

651
00:24:01,218 --> 00:24:02,466
You wanna run that
by me again?

652
00:24:02,552 --> 00:24:03,567
Slicing and dicing is...

653
00:24:03,653 --> 00:24:05,236
I know what
slicing and dicing is, Alex.

654
00:24:05,389 --> 00:24:07,804
You tell me your big idea is to split
his commercial division

655
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,318
from his retail? 'Cause I told you
the survival of his company

656
00:24:10,403 --> 00:24:11,888
- was important to me.
- I know that Louis.

657
00:24:11,973 --> 00:24:13,186
But this is the
only way out.

658
00:24:13,271 --> 00:24:15,012
Cutting someone's arm off
is not a way out.

659
00:24:15,098 --> 00:24:16,583
It is if their life
depends on it.

660
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:18,244
In this way, we have a chance
to get Winthrop

661
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:20,184
back to the table
before we cut anything off.

662
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,802
Listen to me. We are not
going back to Thomas

663
00:24:22,888 --> 00:24:25,806
saying, "Congratulations,
now you're a three-legged dog."

664
00:24:25,872 --> 00:24:28,165
And I'm telling you
this is the only play.

665
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:29,544
You're...

666
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,286
You know what?

667
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:33,177
This was a mistake.

668
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:35,028
I take full responsibility.

669
00:24:35,114 --> 00:24:37,363
Things were fine.
I do not want them to change.

670
00:24:37,505 --> 00:24:39,599
Louis, it doesn't matter
whether you handle this or...

671
00:24:39,684 --> 00:24:41,559
Goddamn it, Alex,

672
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,395
it may be
the only play for you,

673
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:45,023
but it is not for me.

674
00:24:45,473 --> 00:24:49,096
Now, I told you I would do
anything to keep him alive,

675
00:24:49,181 --> 00:24:51,505
and it's gonna start with me
taking back this case.

676
00:24:56,348 --> 00:24:58,223
- Louis...
- Gretchen, whatever it is,

677
00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:00,450
I don't have time
'cause Alex shit the bed

678
00:25:00,536 --> 00:25:02,019
with Thomas
and I need to fix it.

679
00:25:02,104 --> 00:25:04,314
Well, you better make time,
because Andrew Malik

680
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:06,651
just trashed this firm
in the Journal.

681
00:25:07,651 --> 00:25:09,276
Shit,
so that's what he's up to.

682
00:25:09,362 --> 00:25:10,646
You want me to get
Harvey in here?

683
00:25:10,731 --> 00:25:12,794
No, it's his case.

684
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,833
I don't wanna get involved.
If you ask me,

685
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:16,878
you need to let Alex
handle his business

686
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:19,485
and start making sure
Harvey isn't ruining yours.

687
00:25:19,664 --> 00:25:21,748
Gretchen, I appreciate you
bringing me this,

688
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,262
but what I need is
to run my firm

689
00:25:23,348 --> 00:25:24,764
how I feel it should be run,

690
00:25:24,918 --> 00:25:26,793
and now, that means
taking care of Thomas

691
00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:29,192
and trusting that Harvey
will take care of himself.

692
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,934
You're the boss.

693
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:40,255
Well, that was fast.

694
00:25:40,341 --> 00:25:42,223
Told you,
I'm good at what I do.

695
00:25:42,895 --> 00:25:45,106
These are the top three
candidates in the city.

696
00:25:45,192 --> 00:25:48,216
You are not gonna find a more
qualified lawyer anywhere.

697
00:25:48,302 --> 00:25:50,430
Wow. Okay.
But you should hire this one.

698
00:25:53,322 --> 00:25:55,906
I'm sorry, you want me
to pass on these superheroes

699
00:25:55,991 --> 00:25:59,619
for a guy who graduated middle
of his class from SUNY Buffalo?

700
00:26:00,255 --> 00:26:02,255
Did you check to see whether
my nana's available?

701
00:26:02,356 --> 00:26:04,512
Thomas,
he didn't go to Harvard

702
00:26:04,598 --> 00:26:07,293
and he graduated the middle of
his class for the same reason.

703
00:26:07,645 --> 00:26:09,887
He was working full-time
to put himself through school.

704
00:26:09,973 --> 00:26:11,223
And if you give him a shot,

705
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:13,247
he will go to the ends
of the Earth for you.

706
00:26:14,496 --> 00:26:15,976
And on top of that,
you're gonna love him.

707
00:26:16,061 --> 00:26:17,061
He's just like you.

708
00:26:17,221 --> 00:26:18,847
- Handsome.
- Stupid.

709
00:26:18,932 --> 00:26:20,056
But is he funny?

710
00:26:20,325 --> 00:26:21,459
Because he can't
be funnier than me.

711
00:26:21,544 --> 00:26:23,505
We can't have that.
Bad for morale.

712
00:26:23,747 --> 00:26:25,123
Not so much other people,
just mine,

713
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,416
but still, it... You know.

714
00:26:26,757 --> 00:26:28,059
Can I go now?

715
00:26:28,278 --> 00:26:29,982
Yes, you can.

716
00:26:30,395 --> 00:26:31,568
And listen,
thank you for this.

717
00:26:31,653 --> 00:26:33,786
Um, I'm gonna meet with Brendon
as soon as I can.

718
00:26:33,872 --> 00:26:35,872
Great.
Would you tell Louis

719
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:37,948
I'll send those contracts
at the end of the day?

720
00:26:38,247 --> 00:26:39,617
- Louis?
- Yeah.

721
00:26:39,702 --> 00:26:41,285
I gotta say,
I appreciate the fact

722
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,496
that he hasn't handed me off
to somebody else.

723
00:26:43,637 --> 00:26:44,896
I didn't think
that he would keep me,

724
00:26:44,981 --> 00:26:47,294
considering he's got an entire
firm to run, but...

725
00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:50,161
- pretty amazing guy.
- Yes, he is.

726
00:26:52,223 --> 00:26:53,673
Let me know how it goes
with Brendon.

727
00:26:53,758 --> 00:26:55,020
Will do.

728
00:26:56,594 --> 00:26:58,969
Pow-pow!
Pow, pow, pow, pow!

729
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,223
I'm done, baby.

730
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,140
Looking good, champ.

731
00:27:03,225 --> 00:27:04,559
Getting ready
for a rematch?

732
00:27:04,746 --> 00:27:06,477
- You're Jim's lawyer, right?
- I am.

733
00:27:06,562 --> 00:27:07,966
I'll need your help
with his defense.

734
00:27:08,051 --> 00:27:11,097
I got excelled... in boxing for 30 years,
but it's not often

735
00:27:11,183 --> 00:27:13,191
you've to come face-to-face
with the likes of you.

736
00:27:13,277 --> 00:27:15,403
You looking to test yourself,
that's a bad idea.

737
00:27:15,488 --> 00:27:16,780
I'm here to pick your brain.

738
00:27:16,865 --> 00:27:19,058
The guy I spar with,
whenever he throws a hook,

739
00:27:19,144 --> 00:27:20,864
- I never see it coming.
- Here's the thing:

740
00:27:20,949 --> 00:27:22,996
You don't have to see it
as long as you move inside.

741
00:27:23,134 --> 00:27:25,730
- You're saying work the body?
- I'm saying you...

742
00:27:25,816 --> 00:27:27,722
that right kidney enough times,

743
00:27:27,808 --> 00:27:28,895
he ain't throwing that hook.

744
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,262
You go to the body
too often...

745
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:32,138
- What about the uppercut?
- That's why you gotta

746
00:27:32,223 --> 00:27:34,094
- stick and move.
- But if you stick and move,

747
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,933
you could walk
into that left cross.

748
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:37,974
That can't hurt as long
as you keep your hands up.

749
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:39,559
Then let me
ask you something Rickie..

750
00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:42,263
Why didn't you keep
your hands up against Alonzo?

751
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,014
- What?
- You dropped your hands

752
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:45,767
against Alonzo,
and I know why.

753
00:27:45,852 --> 00:27:47,129
You took a dive.

754
00:27:47,478 --> 00:27:49,629
Yo, what the fuck
you just say to me, man?

755
00:27:49,957 --> 00:27:52,301
'Cause anyone that knows me
knows I would never do that.

756
00:27:52,387 --> 00:27:54,788
Really? Because, I have a whole list
of people that know you.

757
00:27:54,879 --> 00:27:56,777
If I have to put them
on the witness stand,

758
00:27:56,863 --> 00:27:59,322
they'll testify that you
told them to bet against you.

759
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:01,657
So, unless you're telling me
that Jim was in on it...

760
00:28:01,743 --> 00:28:03,004
Jim had nothing
to do with it.

761
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,182
You better call a lawyer
and call one fast.

762
00:28:05,485 --> 00:28:06,785
Wait, stop.

763
00:28:07,703 --> 00:28:09,855
I would've killed
to be in your shoes.

764
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:12,613
You had your whole career
ahead of you.

765
00:28:12,699 --> 00:28:14,949
I didn't have shit
ahead of me!

766
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,598
What are you
talking about?

767
00:28:19,343 --> 00:28:21,427
Three months ago,
I went to go pick up

768
00:28:21,512 --> 00:28:23,805
my daughter from kindergarten,
all right?

769
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,504
At a certain point,
I didn't remember

770
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,558
why I was in my car
or where I was going.

771
00:28:27,727 --> 00:28:31,340
Drove around an hour,
trying to remember,

772
00:28:31,832 --> 00:28:33,504
till the school
finally called me.

773
00:28:34,233 --> 00:28:37,426
Yo, I'm 35 years old, man.
You know how messed up that is?

774
00:28:37,527 --> 00:28:38,933
I know how
messed up it is

775
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:41,572
to let Jim go on trial
for a crime you committed.

776
00:28:41,657 --> 00:28:43,908
Well, Jim hasn't been
getting his head bashed in

777
00:28:43,993 --> 00:28:45,488
since he was 15,
all right?

778
00:28:45,703 --> 00:28:47,980
And-and I need to provide
for my family.

779
00:28:48,247 --> 00:28:50,949
'Cause where am I gonna be
in 10 years, huh?

780
00:28:51,058 --> 00:28:52,887
Am I gonna be able
to hold down a job?

781
00:28:53,379 --> 00:28:56,035
Am I gonna need somebody
to wipe my ass?

782
00:28:56,121 --> 00:28:57,496
I don't know, Ricky.

783
00:28:57,717 --> 00:29:00,009
All I know is
Jim is innocent.

784
00:29:00,141 --> 00:29:02,977
And it's my job to make sure
the world knows it.

785
00:29:07,652 --> 00:29:09,988
Louis? I just talked
to Thomas, and he said

786
00:29:10,074 --> 00:29:11,582
you took the case
back from Alex.

787
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:13,590
He wanted to mutilate
the man's company.

788
00:29:13,676 --> 00:29:15,660
I'm not gonna let him.
What about your company?

789
00:29:15,746 --> 00:29:17,957
Because, I'm willing to bet
my entire salary you haven't

790
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:19,591
even looked at
the stack of files I left.

791
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:23,553
I was working on it, Donna.
Then Gretchen walked in with...

792
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:25,785
With what?

793
00:29:30,785 --> 00:29:32,895
I don't believe this.
What are you gonna do about that?

794
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,376
- I'm not gonna do anything.
- Malik's making us look like shit

795
00:29:35,461 --> 00:29:37,707
and you're not gonna
at least talk to Harvey about it?

796
00:29:37,793 --> 00:29:40,457
No, I'm not. I'm gonna tell you
exactly what I told Gretchen.

797
00:29:40,543 --> 00:29:42,871
I am managing this firm
as I see fit.

798
00:29:42,964 --> 00:29:45,090
Then I'll tell you
what Gretchen should have.

799
00:29:45,471 --> 00:29:47,418
- You're doing a shitty job.
- Excuse me?

800
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:49,465
You're doing a shitty job
as Managing Partner.

801
00:29:49,551 --> 00:29:50,473
I'm not gonna let that happen.

802
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,268
You're not gonna...
I'm your goddamn boss!

803
00:29:53,354 --> 00:29:54,621
Yeah, because
I put you there.

804
00:29:54,707 --> 00:29:56,665
No, you didn't put me shit.

805
00:29:56,899 --> 00:29:59,222
You begged me to save
this firm, and I did.

806
00:29:59,308 --> 00:30:01,629
While we're talking
about this firm and bosses,

807
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:04,074
you're also Harvey's boss
and Robert's boss,

808
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,489
and you haven't been
overseeing them.

809
00:30:05,574 --> 00:30:07,909
You said to delegate.
That is exactly what I did.

810
00:30:07,994 --> 00:30:10,369
You weren't delegating, Louis.
You're abdicating.

811
00:30:11,738 --> 00:30:13,168
And you're using Thomas' case

812
00:30:13,254 --> 00:30:14,731
to stay in your comfort zone
rather than...

813
00:30:14,816 --> 00:30:17,152
I am not giving up
my clients.

814
00:30:19,189 --> 00:30:20,543
I'm sorry to tell you
this, Louis,

815
00:30:20,629 --> 00:30:22,546
but what you want
doesn't matter anymore.

816
00:30:23,058 --> 00:30:24,418
And I'll tell you
something else.

817
00:30:24,504 --> 00:30:26,473
It's not about your clients
anymore, either.

818
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,379
It is about
steering the ship.

819
00:30:30,885 --> 00:30:32,519
And you haven't been
steering it, either.

820
00:30:40,308 --> 00:30:41,317
Katrina.

821
00:30:41,566 --> 00:30:43,111
Funny, I was just coming
to see you.

822
00:30:43,262 --> 00:30:44,612
Well, that won't
be necessary.

823
00:30:44,823 --> 00:30:46,733
I assume that means
you've done what I asked.

824
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:48,950
No. I did what
Donna asked.

825
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:51,744
She figured out what was
going on and wanted to step in.

826
00:30:51,829 --> 00:30:54,558
And let me guess, you said
you'd rather handle me yourself.

827
00:30:54,946 --> 00:30:56,222
I did.

828
00:30:56,667 --> 00:30:58,223
And like I said,

829
00:30:58,706 --> 00:31:00,335
this isn't what
you asked me to do.

830
00:31:00,754 --> 00:31:01,754
Then what is it?

831
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,213
I went through
Dexhart's files

832
00:31:03,298 --> 00:31:04,882
and found $10 million
in savings

833
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:07,384
by closing loopholes
in their policy exclusions.

834
00:31:07,469 --> 00:31:08,970
They lost 80 million.

835
00:31:09,055 --> 00:31:10,972
And if you
can't explain to them

836
00:31:11,057 --> 00:31:12,567
that this is just the tip
of the iceberg

837
00:31:12,652 --> 00:31:15,236
in making them whole,
that's on you.

838
00:31:15,686 --> 00:31:19,814
What's on me is to say
that you will not determine

839
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:21,649
the type of lawyer
I want to be.

840
00:31:22,191 --> 00:31:23,651
What is that
supposed to mean?

841
00:31:23,736 --> 00:31:27,071
It means I looked into those
details like Louis would.

842
00:31:27,254 --> 00:31:29,115
I found another way
like Harvey would.

843
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,051
And you want me to accept it
like who would?

844
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,750
Because you left out Robert.

845
00:31:37,054 --> 00:31:38,499
And I don't think
if you did to him

846
00:31:38,584 --> 00:31:40,250
what you did to me,
he'd accept it.

847
00:31:40,335 --> 00:31:42,211
And I don't think
Robert would've done

848
00:31:42,296 --> 00:31:44,202
what you did to me
in the first place.

849
00:31:44,924 --> 00:31:46,226
But in addition to this,

850
00:31:46,312 --> 00:31:48,020
I'm willing to say
I owe you one.

851
00:31:48,452 --> 00:31:50,991
So make an enemy
of me or not.

852
00:31:51,405 --> 00:31:53,188
That's the best
you're going to get.

853
00:31:57,955 --> 00:31:59,421
"Well," what?

854
00:31:59,593 --> 00:32:01,749
I got a call from Ricky
telling me what happened

855
00:32:01,975 --> 00:32:03,257
and asking me
what we're gonna do.

856
00:32:03,342 --> 00:32:05,203
What do you think we're going to do?
We'll wait for Malik

857
00:32:05,288 --> 00:32:06,736
to make a fool of himself,
and then show

858
00:32:06,821 --> 00:32:08,571
- he got the wrong guy.
- In other words,

859
00:32:08,656 --> 00:32:09,906
throw Ricky
under the bus.

860
00:32:09,991 --> 00:32:12,825
Not in other words,
in those exact words.

861
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,869
Harvey, the man
has brain damage.

862
00:32:14,954 --> 00:32:16,746
I don't give a shit
what he has.

863
00:32:16,831 --> 00:32:18,664
He was gonna let his mentor
go to prison.

864
00:32:18,827 --> 00:32:20,203
You don't know
what he would've done

865
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:22,765
- if it had come to that.
- I know that he threw off a fight

866
00:32:22,851 --> 00:32:25,755
in the sport I love, and what
happens to him isn't my problem.

867
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,049
You must live in
a damn nice glass house.

868
00:32:28,134 --> 00:32:29,898
You designed... of the fact that
you threw a fight

869
00:32:29,983 --> 00:32:31,383
on behalf of one
of your own clients.

870
00:32:31,468 --> 00:32:32,625
If you're talking
about Reform Corp...

871
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,543
I'm talking about
William Sutter.

872
00:32:35,114 --> 00:32:36,969
You think Rachel
never told me about that?

873
00:32:37,063 --> 00:32:38,452
That was to get Mike
out of prison.

874
00:32:38,648 --> 00:32:41,280
And Ricky threw a fight
to take care of his family.

875
00:32:41,366 --> 00:32:43,992
Look. if you're so sure of yourself,
what do you think we should do?

876
00:32:44,077 --> 00:32:45,942
We should go to Malik,
tell him he has the wrong guy,

877
00:32:46,027 --> 00:32:47,757
and cut the best deal
we can for Ricky.

878
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:49,593
Are you out of your mind?
We took this thing

879
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,265
to get payback for Jessica.
Ricky is our trump card.

880
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:56,368
Now, if you're not okay with
this, the door is right there.

881
00:32:56,453 --> 00:32:58,093
I'm not going anywhere,
and this case

882
00:32:58,179 --> 00:32:59,805
is as much mine
as it is yours.

883
00:32:59,891 --> 00:33:01,808
It's not either one of yours.
It's mine.

884
00:33:01,894 --> 00:33:03,937
Excuse me?
I said, it is mine.

885
00:33:04,265 --> 00:33:07,004
I'm not gonna let you jeopardize
this firm with some vendetta.

886
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:09,423
What happened to me
being a wild stallion?

887
00:33:09,508 --> 00:33:12,288
What happened is I was afraid
to tell you the truth.

888
00:33:12,803 --> 00:33:15,054
And the truth is,
I am running this place,

889
00:33:15,139 --> 00:33:16,874
and we all need to get
on board with that,

890
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,202
and it starts
with you reading me in.

891
00:33:19,852 --> 00:33:22,019
Okay, Louis.
We'll read you in.

892
00:33:22,104 --> 00:33:25,343
But there is no way I am
letting Malik off the hook.

893
00:33:26,968 --> 00:33:28,676
Look, we've been over this
all night.

894
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:31,888
It comes down to a choice
between cutting Ricky a deal

895
00:33:31,973 --> 00:33:34,483
and payback with Malik,
and I am not going...

896
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:36,679
Wait a second.
Payback. That's it.

897
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,820
What's "it," Louis?
Where are you going with this?

898
00:33:40,054 --> 00:33:41,522
How much revenue
has Jim lost

899
00:33:41,608 --> 00:33:42,648
since these charges
were brought?

900
00:33:42,733 --> 00:33:45,241
I don't know. His license is suspended.
He hasn't been able

901
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:46,611
to book a fight.
What's your point?

902
00:33:46,696 --> 00:33:49,538
My point is, once we show he's innocent,
someone needs to pay back

903
00:33:49,624 --> 00:33:51,851
all the revenue he's lost.
That someone is Andrew Malik.

904
00:33:51,937 --> 00:33:54,898
Louis, I don't wanna take his money.
I want to ruin his reputation.

905
00:33:54,984 --> 00:33:57,526
What Louis is saying
is that Malik won't pay it.

906
00:33:57,858 --> 00:34:00,780
The state will.
Which means the voters will.

907
00:34:01,007 --> 00:34:03,085
You talking about
suing him for compensation

908
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:04,670
under the Wrongful
Prosecution Act?

909
00:34:04,755 --> 00:34:06,312
You bet your
sweet hindquarters I am.

910
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:08,315
Which means he either
cuts Ricky a deal,

911
00:34:08,401 --> 00:34:11,235
or any higher-office aspirations
he has, they're done.

912
00:34:11,393 --> 00:34:13,491
You think Jim Allen
will forgo a lawsuit

913
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,851
just to get Ricky
a better deal?

914
00:34:14,937 --> 00:34:17,483
Once he finds out
why Ricky did it, yeah, he will.

915
00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:18,828
Harvey, there's only one problem.

916
00:34:18,913 --> 00:34:20,757
You wanted to ruin
Malik's reputation.

917
00:34:20,855 --> 00:34:22,186
This deal won't do that.

918
00:34:22,272 --> 00:34:23,601
You leave that to me.

919
00:34:23,983 --> 00:34:25,421
And, Louis,

920
00:34:25,985 --> 00:34:27,277
you're a genius.

921
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:28,861
No, Harvey.

922
00:34:29,046 --> 00:34:30,483
I'm just...

923
00:34:31,491 --> 00:34:33,132
a Managing Partner.

924
00:34:38,956 --> 00:34:40,081
What's that for?

925
00:34:40,265 --> 00:34:41,569
Your wife told me
you were here.

926
00:34:41,655 --> 00:34:43,163
I wanted to pick up the check.

927
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,462
I'm sorry, Alex.

928
00:34:45,796 --> 00:34:47,944
I gave you the case,
and I need to trust

929
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,710
you're gonna bring it home
how you see fit.

930
00:34:49,851 --> 00:34:51,233
Well, I'm sorry too.

931
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:52,885
- What do you mean?
- I gave up too quickly.

932
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:54,055
If it weren't for you
pushing me,

933
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,602
I wouldn't have figured
the way out of this thing.

934
00:34:55,687 --> 00:34:58,038
The way out?
Yes, Louis, the way out.

935
00:34:58,124 --> 00:34:59,248
Because, I got to thinking.

936
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:00,944
Larry didn't just make
one mistake.

937
00:35:01,107 --> 00:35:02,357
He made two.

938
00:35:02,788 --> 00:35:04,481
He never ran
the final contract by you.

939
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:06,311
Holy shit, he didn't.
He always does

940
00:35:06,397 --> 00:35:08,401
because he knows...
You'll catch any mistake.

941
00:35:08,486 --> 00:35:09,679
He didn't make a mistake.

942
00:35:09,765 --> 00:35:11,530
No, Louis,
it was on purpose.

943
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:13,655
Isn't it a coincidence
that Larry just signed

944
00:35:13,741 --> 00:35:16,159
a contract to work
at a subsidiary of Winthrop?

945
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,522
Alex, this is brilliant.

946
00:35:17,608 --> 00:35:18,953
We need to get them
on the phone right now.

947
00:35:19,038 --> 00:35:20,372
Already taken care of,
Louis.

948
00:35:20,457 --> 00:35:22,483
Contract is back
exactly the way it was.

949
00:35:22,577 --> 00:35:23,766
Well, with
a 25 percent increase,

950
00:35:23,851 --> 00:35:26,210
and by 25, I mean 40.

951
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,167
Nice work, Alex.

952
00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:30,851
Right back at you, Louis.

953
00:35:35,889 --> 00:35:36,971
Let me get this straight.

954
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:38,973
You'll come at me
for Jim Allen's losses

955
00:35:39,058 --> 00:35:41,476
if I prosecute Ricky Crosby,
who you know is guilty

956
00:35:41,561 --> 00:35:43,256
and wasn't even your client
until today?

957
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:44,701
What he was
isn't important.

958
00:35:44,787 --> 00:35:46,365
What he is,
is getting a deal.

959
00:35:46,522 --> 00:35:48,483
So. take your medicine
and count yourself lucky

960
00:35:48,568 --> 00:35:50,151
that we're willing
to horse-trade.

961
00:35:50,236 --> 00:35:52,248
If we weren't, you'd be
fucked right now.

962
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,698
Which you are anyway
because you're gonna be issuing

963
00:35:54,783 --> 00:35:57,436
a public apology for going
after an innocent man.

964
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:00,286
No way. I admit that,
it ruins me for higher office.

965
00:36:00,371 --> 00:36:01,600
What do you think
I'm here for?

966
00:36:01,686 --> 00:36:03,437
You wouldn't be in this position
if you didn't

967
00:36:03,522 --> 00:36:05,553
go after an innocent man
in the first place.

968
00:36:07,428 --> 00:36:10,701
I will issue an apology
first thing tomorrow.

969
00:36:10,842 --> 00:36:12,639
No, you will issue one now.

970
00:36:12,936 --> 00:36:14,983
We're not giving you a chance
to weasel out of this.

971
00:36:15,069 --> 00:36:17,553
We even did you a solid
and wrote one up for you.

972
00:36:17,654 --> 00:36:19,013
Robert,
did you know there are

973
00:36:19,098 --> 00:36:21,740
12 different synonyms
for the word "incompetent"?

974
00:36:21,826 --> 00:36:24,279
After he signs this,
there's gonna be a 13th:

975
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,139
"Malik."

976
00:36:27,537 --> 00:36:29,023
You know, you think
this is funny.

977
00:36:29,108 --> 00:36:31,484
But sob story or not,
a crime was committed here,

978
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:35,194
and you are using it
to ruin my career.

979
00:36:35,862 --> 00:36:37,358
So you...

980
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:40,873
You better
watch your backs.

981
00:36:41,871 --> 00:36:44,303
Tomorrow's gonna be
what tomorrow's gonna be, Andy.

982
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,795
But for today,

983
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,920
Jessica Pearson
sends her regards.

984
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,764
Katrina. I was on my way out
to meet my wife for dinner.

985
00:37:02,928 --> 00:37:04,726
You're gonna have
to push that reservation.

986
00:37:04,811 --> 00:37:06,978
I'm not going to sit on this
another minute.

987
00:37:07,063 --> 00:37:09,564
- Sit on what?
- The fact that you sold me out.

988
00:37:09,649 --> 00:37:11,899
- I did no such thing.
- Yes, you did.

989
00:37:11,984 --> 00:37:13,777
Because when you signed
Gavin Andrews,

990
00:37:13,862 --> 00:37:16,070
I specifically asked you
to make sure Samantha

991
00:37:16,155 --> 00:37:17,947
never found out
I gave you his name.

992
00:37:18,032 --> 00:37:19,584
She never did.
I never told her.

993
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,752
You might as well have.

994
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,576
Because, two days ago,
she came at me

995
00:37:22,662 --> 00:37:23,663
saying she knew
I was the one

996
00:37:23,748 --> 00:37:24,967
who got those
files for you,

997
00:37:25,122 --> 00:37:26,678
and unless I did
some shady

998
00:37:26,764 --> 00:37:28,170
- shit for...
- Shit.

999
00:37:28,264 --> 00:37:29,842
Katrina, I'm gonna
go tell her right now

1000
00:37:29,928 --> 00:37:32,316
- to back the hell off.
- You're not gonna tell her anything.

1001
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:33,545
I handled it.

1002
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:34,695
Then why are you
coming to me?

1003
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,850
Because, the silver lining
of this whole thing

1004
00:37:36,936 --> 00:37:38,468
is it gave me a chance
to figure out

1005
00:37:38,553 --> 00:37:40,178
what kind of lawyer
I wanna be.

1006
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:42,412
And the kind of lawyer
I want to be is one

1007
00:37:42,514 --> 00:37:46,733
who tells you to never put me
in this position again.

1008
00:37:48,084 --> 00:37:50,146
- Fair enough.
- Good.

1009
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,147
- Is that all?
- No.

1010
00:37:52,264 --> 00:37:53,433
It's not.

1011
00:37:53,526 --> 00:37:56,545
Because I also want to be
the kind who tells you...

1012
00:37:57,405 --> 00:37:58,834
you owe me one.

1013
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:10,392
Hello, stupid.

1014
00:38:10,478 --> 00:38:12,276
You calling to tell me
how a certain interview went?

1015
00:38:12,361 --> 00:38:14,744
I am.
Met with Brendon.

1016
00:38:14,885 --> 00:38:17,131
It went great.
Hired him on the spot.

1017
00:38:17,243 --> 00:38:20,127
- In other words, I'm amazing.
- You are.

1018
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:21,971
Which brings me to why
I'm really calling.

1019
00:38:23,598 --> 00:38:26,684
I don't think Brendon's the
only one I have chemistry with.

1020
00:38:28,188 --> 00:38:29,727
- Thomas...
- Have dinner with me.

1021
00:38:29,813 --> 00:38:31,312
Thomas, I'm flattered,

1022
00:38:31,397 --> 00:38:32,938
but you're a client, and...

1023
00:38:33,023 --> 00:38:34,472
Before you finish,
let me ask you this:

1024
00:38:34,557 --> 00:38:37,058
If I wasn't a client,
what would you say?

1025
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,775
- I'd say yes.
- Okay, then.

1026
00:38:39,861 --> 00:38:41,205
Here's what I'm gonna do.

1027
00:38:41,431 --> 00:38:43,282
I'm gonna give you
a bit of time,

1028
00:38:43,486 --> 00:38:44,617
I'm gonna ask you once more,

1029
00:38:44,702 --> 00:38:46,369
and if you still feel
the same way,

1030
00:38:46,454 --> 00:38:48,496
then I promise
I will never ask again.

1031
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:50,331
Fair?

1032
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,541
Fair.

1033
00:38:51,626 --> 00:38:52,667
Good.

1034
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,877
And listen, Donna, either way,

1035
00:38:55,213 --> 00:38:57,650
thank you for keeping
my business going.

1036
00:39:01,845 --> 00:39:03,010
Donna?

1037
00:39:03,806 --> 00:39:04,960
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

1038
00:39:05,045 --> 00:39:06,252
About what?

1039
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:07,766
About Katrina.

1040
00:39:08,002 --> 00:39:09,768
Samantha, before you jump
all over me...

1041
00:39:09,853 --> 00:39:12,937
I'm here to say I shouldn't
have done what I did.

1042
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:15,728
- But?
- But...

1043
00:39:15,994 --> 00:39:17,792
you could have come
and told me that yourself.

1044
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:19,669
Maybe.

1045
00:39:20,056 --> 00:39:21,064
But the more I do this,

1046
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,530
the more I realize
that sometimes

1047
00:39:22,615 --> 00:39:25,324
people just need to learn
things on their own.

1048
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:28,119
I guess I did need
to learn that on my own.

1049
00:39:28,205 --> 00:39:29,564
No, I was talking
about Katrina.

1050
00:39:29,689 --> 00:39:31,033
What about me?

1051
00:39:31,332 --> 00:39:33,775
We were just saying what
a great lawyer you're gonna be.

1052
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,322
That's funny,
because I was just coming by

1053
00:39:36,447 --> 00:39:38,546
to tell Donna
what a great COO she is.

1054
00:39:38,631 --> 00:39:40,697
Since we're passing out
compliments,

1055
00:39:40,783 --> 00:39:42,299
what do you say we do it
over drinks?

1056
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,166
- Fine by me.
- Me too.

1057
00:39:44,252 --> 00:39:45,901
How about we meet
in the lobby in 20 minutes?

1058
00:39:45,986 --> 00:39:47,620
I've got something
I need to take care of.

1059
00:39:47,705 --> 00:39:49,080
If you run into Gretchen,

1060
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:52,033
I guarantee you we'll have
a much better time.

1061
00:39:54,647 --> 00:39:55,897
Hey.

1062
00:39:56,462 --> 00:39:57,857
- Do you have a minute?
- Of course.

1063
00:39:57,942 --> 00:40:00,025
I was actually just about
to get to the...

1064
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,193
stack of things you left.

1065
00:40:01,278 --> 00:40:03,306
- Listen, Louis...
- Donna, I am sorry.

1066
00:40:04,072 --> 00:40:05,821
Everything you said
was right.

1067
00:40:05,992 --> 00:40:07,588
I was avoiding the job.

1068
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,596
And if it hadn't been for you,

1069
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,619
I would've gone
right on avoiding it.

1070
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:14,455
I take it this means
you and Alex worked it out.

1071
00:40:14,603 --> 00:40:18,096
- We did.
- Well, I'm sorry too.

1072
00:40:18,806 --> 00:40:21,580
I said terrible things to you,
and I didn't mean them,

1073
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:23,132
and I shouldn't have
said them, and...

1074
00:40:23,217 --> 00:40:24,861
- Donna.
- I know I didn't make you.

1075
00:40:24,947 --> 00:40:26,931
Managing Partner, Louis.

1076
00:40:27,764 --> 00:40:29,689
But I was a part of it,

1077
00:40:29,775 --> 00:40:32,642
and I felt responsible
for it, and...

1078
00:40:32,791 --> 00:40:34,963
You didn't want to regret
making it happen.

1079
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,357
If I'm being
really honest, yeah.

1080
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,244
But the truth is, we all need
to learn in our own time,

1081
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:46,030
and I just found out
I'm no different.

1082
00:40:46,267 --> 00:40:48,283
I'll tell you what.
If I'm keeping score,

1083
00:40:48,369 --> 00:40:50,721
I would say we're both doing
a pretty good job.

1084
00:40:51,353 --> 00:40:54,205
And even if you didn't
put me here...

1085
00:40:54,947 --> 00:40:57,463
Donna, I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for you.

1086
00:40:58,962 --> 00:41:02,681
So... co-Managing Partners?

1087
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:03,963
Let's not get carried away.

1088
00:41:04,072 --> 00:41:05,489
Okay.

1089
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,824
Thank you, Donna.

1090
00:41:07,011 --> 00:41:08,963
- Thanks, Louis.
- Come on, Red.

1091
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,478
Train's leaving the station.
Let's go.

1092
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:13,850
- So you're in.
- You kidding?

1093
00:41:13,935 --> 00:41:15,103
You think
I'm gonna stay here

1094
00:41:15,189 --> 00:41:17,728
and listen to Louis' ideas
on coed bathrooms

1095
00:41:17,814 --> 00:41:19,642
while you fools
go out drinking,

1096
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,557
- you got another thing coming.
- Wait a second.

1097
00:41:21,642 --> 00:41:22,761
You guys going out?
Can I come?

1098
00:41:22,846 --> 00:41:24,158
- No.
- That's fine.

1099
00:41:24,244 --> 00:41:25,323
You go out,
have a good time.

1100
00:41:25,408 --> 00:41:26,994
I got some cool shit
I gotta do.

1101
00:41:28,379 --> 00:41:29,697
I gotta hand it
to you, Robert.

1102
00:41:29,783 --> 00:41:31,056
You really came through.

1103
00:41:31,744 --> 00:41:33,202
Right back at you,
Harvey.

1104
00:41:33,377 --> 00:41:35,556
I'd say
we did our girl proud.

1105
00:41:35,822 --> 00:41:38,002
To Jessica.
To Jessica.

1106
00:41:39,384 --> 00:41:40,714
- What?
- You know, I was just thinking.

1107
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:42,712
I sold Jim that this case
was Rocky IV,

1108
00:41:42,797 --> 00:41:44,034
but it turned out
to be Rocky III.

1109
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:45,881
You mean, the one where
Apollo and Rocky

1110
00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:47,635
come together
to beat Mr. T?

1111
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:49,689
Sure as hell wasn't
talking about Rocky V.

1112
00:41:49,775 --> 00:41:51,526
You know what happens
at the end of Rocky III.

1113
00:41:51,611 --> 00:41:53,721
Yeah, Rocky and Apollo
go toe-to-toe.

1114
00:41:53,869 --> 00:41:56,541
You're wondering what would
happen if we went toe-to-toe.

1115
00:41:56,627 --> 00:41:57,626
I don't need to wonder.

1116
00:41:57,712 --> 00:41:59,462
I know what'd happen.
I'd win.

1117
00:41:59,729 --> 00:42:01,312
Good. Whatever gets you
through the day.

1118
00:42:01,398 --> 00:42:03,357
- Holy shit.
- What?

1119
00:42:03,502 --> 00:42:05,080
We're in here
arguing about

1120
00:42:05,174 --> 00:42:07,028
who's better
between you and me.

1121
00:42:07,142 --> 00:42:08,446
What if Louis turns out

1122
00:42:08,531 --> 00:42:10,830
to be a better Managing Partner
than both of us?

1123
00:42:10,971 --> 00:42:12,825
Jesus Christ, that'd be
the worst Rocky ever.

1124
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:15,392
No, Rocky V is still
the worst Rocky ever.

1125
00:42:15,478 --> 00:42:17,041
Finally, something
we can agree on.

1126
00:42:17,174 --> 00:42:19,330
Truth be told,
I never even saw Rocky VI.

1127
00:42:19,471 --> 00:42:21,000
Neither did anybody else,
Robert.

1128
00:42:21,085 --> 00:42:22,752
You know,
that new Creed franchise,

1129
00:42:22,837 --> 00:42:24,545
oh, that's quite
a little something.

1130
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,916
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1131
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,190
Maybe I should watch it
tonight.

1132
00:42:27,275 --> 00:42:28,681
- Wanna come over?
- Do I look like

1133
00:42:28,767 --> 00:42:29,878
I don't have nothing
to do but to

1134
00:42:29,963 --> 00:42:32,174
come and watch Rocky VII
with your lonely ass?

1135
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,674
But I got popcorn.

1136
00:42:34,424 --> 00:42:35,598
I'll call Laura.

1137
00:42:35,745 --> 00:42:37,921

1138
