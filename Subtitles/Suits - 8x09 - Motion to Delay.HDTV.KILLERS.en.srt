1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,060
<i>Previously on "Suits..."</i>

2
00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:01,990
There was a guard...

3
00:00:02,031 --> 00:00:04,419
who was getting suspicious of
what was going on in there.

4
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,701
They wanted me to put him down.

5
00:00:05,742 --> 00:00:07,466
I told him I wouldn't do it, until...

6
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,785
whoever was running the
show came to me directly.

7
00:00:09,826 --> 00:00:11,114
Who exactly was that?

8
00:00:11,155 --> 00:00:14,144
Roger Shapiro.
CEO of Reform Corp.

9
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:15,146
And then what happened?

10
00:00:15,187 --> 00:00:16,187
I killed him.

11
00:00:16,742 --> 00:00:18,454
So you two
were in on this together.

12
00:00:18,494 --> 00:00:20,247
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

13
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:23,041
You're never gonna pull
this shit again on prisoners.

14
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:25,210
That's a signed confession
from Roger Shapiro,

15
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,078
saying he entered into a
conspiracy, and that conspiracy

16
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:29,309
was arranged by you.

17
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,091
I'm not going to stand here

18
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:33,662
and write my resignation letter
in front of you two.

19
00:00:33,703 --> 00:00:34,762
What's going on with you
and Brian?

20
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:36,708
Donna, he's married.
I would never do it.

21
00:00:36,749 --> 00:00:38,234
I know, but I also
know that the heart

22
00:00:38,275 --> 00:00:39,099
doesn't always listen

23
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,826
to what the brain
says it would never do.

24
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:42,436
- Denise Gallo?
- Who are you?

25
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:45,147
Someone who knew your father.
He wanted you to have this.

26
00:00:45,187 --> 00:00:46,898
- Did you know?
- Know what?

27
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:49,055
That Gavin Andrews was gonna
ask me to launder money for him?

28
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:50,694
I knew he was gonna
ask you to do something.

29
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:52,060
Help me get out of this.

30
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:53,052
What did you do with my money?

31
00:00:53,093 --> 00:00:54,803
I found you a legitimate
business opportunity.

32
00:00:54,843 --> 00:00:56,404
- You're fired.
- I don't think so.

33
00:00:56,445 --> 00:00:57,957
Because if I can do this to you,

34
00:00:57,998 --> 00:01:00,166
imagine what I can do for you.

35
00:01:08,446 --> 00:01:09,829
- Hello?
- There you are.

36
00:01:09,874 --> 00:01:11,397
What the hell time
do you get to the office?

37
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:13,767
I'm at my desk 10 minutes
before I need to every morning

38
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:14,926
Wich means, you tracked me down.

39
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:16,470
The question is, why?

40
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,124
- We've got a situation.
- What did you do now?

41
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:20,223
I didn't do anything.

42
00:01:20,263 --> 00:01:22,478
One of my transport flights
was carrying some art.

43
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,727
Apparently, the whole depressurized,

44
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:25,429
and one of the pieces
got damaged.

45
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,679
- What kind of art?
- The expensive kind.

46
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,750
Well than, it had to be insured.
What's the problem?

47
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,312
The problem is the insurance
inspector just left here,

48
00:01:32,353 --> 00:01:34,251
and the son of a bitch has got
the balls to say

49
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:35,775
they'd sue me for damages.

50
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:37,324
All right, I'll get into it.

51
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,659
Who's the insurance company?

52
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,243
Dexhart Insurance Group.

53
00:01:40,283 --> 00:01:41,509
Shit.

54
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:43,288
What's the matter?
Is that gonna be a problem?

55
00:01:43,328 --> 00:01:45,248
Just tell me, have the papers
been filed yet?

56
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:47,788
Why do you think
I'm calling you this early?

57
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:54,079
Louis...

58
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:55,843
...this is silly.
Where are you taking me?

59
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:57,515
Relax, we're there.

60
00:01:57,648 --> 00:01:59,209
Then can I take off
this blindfold?

61
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,072
No.

62
00:02:00,113 --> 00:02:02,871
Not until you guess exactly
where we are right now.

63
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:04,802
We're in my new office.

64
00:02:04,843 --> 00:02:06,513
What the f...
How could you know that?

65
00:02:06,554 --> 00:02:08,711
Because you told me I'd make
senior partner next quarter,

66
00:02:08,751 --> 00:02:09,812
and it's next quarter.

67
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:11,119
Now, can I take this blindfold off?

68
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,867
Holy shit. You just suck the fun
out of everything, don't you?

69
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:16,736
In that case,

70
00:02:17,226 --> 00:02:19,275
I have dreamt about
making senior partner

71
00:02:19,316 --> 00:02:20,978
since I was 9 years old.

72
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,496
You not only fought
for me to get this,

73
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,025
I wouldn't even be
at this firm without you.

74
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:29,907
And on top of all that...

75
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:31,001
Louis...

76
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,187
this office is the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

77
00:02:37,172 --> 00:02:39,166
All right. I was wrong.

78
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:41,249
You don't suck the fun
out of anything.

79
00:02:42,172 --> 00:02:43,635
Thank you, Louis.

80
00:02:44,073 --> 00:02:45,707
Thank you for fighting for me.

81
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,051
Samantha, we need to talk.

82
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,966
- Let me guess. Gavin called you.
- He did.

83
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:53,282
Then you know
we have a conflict,

84
00:02:53,322 --> 00:02:55,476
which means, one of us
has to drop their client, so...

85
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:56,570
Do you have Gavin's
private line,

86
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,782
or do you need me
to give it to you?

87
00:02:57,822 --> 00:02:58,781
I don't need anything,

88
00:02:58,822 --> 00:03:00,198
because you're gonna call
up Dexhart Insurance

89
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:01,868
and tell them you can't handle
this particular matter.

90
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:02,632
Are you kidding me?

91
00:03:02,673 --> 00:03:04,035
You wouldn't even have Gavin
if it weren't for me.

92
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:05,993
Doesn't matter how I got him.
I'm not dropping him.

93
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:08,242
Alex I told you, the guy
isn't worth the trouble.

94
00:03:08,283 --> 00:03:10,756
View this as an opportunity
to cut him loose and be done.

95
00:03:10,797 --> 00:03:11,436
Wait a second.

96
00:03:11,476 --> 00:03:14,537
Did your client say they wanted to
sue mine, or did you suggest to it?

97
00:03:14,578 --> 00:03:15,338
What difference does it make?

98
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:17,033
The difference is,
I thought we were past this.

99
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:18,884
Well, if this is how you're making
your play for partner,

100
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:19,523
it's not gonna work.

101
00:03:19,564 --> 00:03:22,367
The only play I'm making is to
protect my client from yours,

102
00:03:22,408 --> 00:03:24,162
because Gavin
sabotaged that plane.

103
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,060
And I know that

104
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:26,709
because I know everything
else he's done.

105
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,627
And you just admitted using privileged
information against a former client.

106
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,352
And I'm not gonna have you
tossed of this just for that.

107
00:03:31,392 --> 00:03:32,774
You mean information,
like using a member

108
00:03:32,814 --> 00:03:34,023
of your client's family
against them?

109
00:03:34,063 --> 00:03:35,377
That's not breaking privilege.
And you know it.

110
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:37,444
Neither is catching that asshole
with his hand in the cookie jar.

111
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,488
Cut the bullshit Samantha
and step out of the ring.

112
00:03:39,528 --> 00:03:41,844
Because this thing isn't happening,
no matter how much you want it to.

113
00:03:41,884 --> 00:03:43,289
I don't want it.
My client does.

114
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,620
And I've never stepped out
of a ring in my life.

115
00:03:45,661 --> 00:03:47,998
So, either call Gavin,
or someone can do it for you,

116
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:50,066
because this case
is moving forward.

117
00:04:00,102 --> 00:04:02,523
Nice home you've made
for yourself here, Robert.

118
00:04:02,564 --> 00:04:04,972
Nicer than the home
you should have, Tommy,

119
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:06,317
since you belong in prison.

120
00:04:06,358 --> 00:04:08,970
Funny you say that, because
that's why I'm here.

121
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:10,035
What are you talking about?

122
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:12,479
Talking about he fact that you're
sitting pretty in this firm

123
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,949
after you forced me out of mine.

124
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,277
You're lucky that's all I did.

125
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:18,486
Because you're responsible for
the deaths of multiple inmates.

126
00:04:18,527 --> 00:04:20,689
- According to you.
- According to Frank Gallo.

127
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,197
That's right,
you got him on tape

128
00:04:22,237 --> 00:04:24,115
saying what monsters we all are.

129
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,720
And then you used it to blackmail
me into early retirement.

130
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:29,822
But that gave me
plenty of time to think.

131
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:32,697
Why the hell would Frank Gallo
cooperate with you

132
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:34,767
if it meant admitting to murder?

133
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,143
What are you getting at, Tommy?

134
00:04:36,184 --> 00:04:37,135
You and this firm

135
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:40,726
offered Frank Gallo money
for his daughter in exchange

136
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:44,246
for fabricated testimony
that you used to leverage me.

137
00:04:44,298 --> 00:04:45,594
And now I'm here...

138
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:47,092
to make you pay.

139
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,976
You're coming at us to get revenge
for something you actually did?

140
00:04:51,016 --> 00:04:53,838
I'm coming at you
for what's owed to me,

141
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:56,481
which is compensation
for the firm that I lost.

142
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:58,358
How about you compensate
the families

143
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,238
of the people
that you had killed?

144
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:03,822
Because the only thing that you are
owed are a pair of prison stripes.

145
00:05:03,862 --> 00:05:06,582
And if you do this,
I promise you'll get them.

146
00:05:06,775 --> 00:05:08,439
Robert, if I wanted empty threats,

147
00:05:08,486 --> 00:05:10,506
I would have brought this
right to Harvey.

148
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,664
But I didn't,
because I wanted to be here

149
00:05:12,704 --> 00:05:15,000
to see the look on your face
when you realized

150
00:05:15,313 --> 00:05:19,566
I'm going to take you all down,
just like you did to me.

151
00:05:54,997 --> 00:05:55,754
Let me get this straight.

152
00:05:55,795 --> 00:05:58,152
Tommy Bratton is
accusing us of conspiracy,

153
00:05:58,193 --> 00:05:59,779
and suing us for $20 million.

154
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,894
Blackmailing us for
$20 million dollars.

155
00:06:01,935 --> 00:06:04,481
Call it what you want.
I'm not giving that son of a bitch one nickel.

156
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:06,699
What are we gonna do, Robert?
Because I hate to say it:

157
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,882
we did conspire with you.

158
00:06:07,923 --> 00:06:09,223
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

159
00:06:09,263 --> 00:06:12,352
We'll go through every piece
of communication on that case

160
00:06:12,393 --> 00:06:14,439
and make sure there is nothing
lingking me to this firm.

161
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,359
Robert, I went to your house.
Mike went to your house.

162
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,197
We never exchanged one e-mail,
phone call. We're good.

163
00:06:21,238 --> 00:06:23,992
I don't feel like risking
my future on your memory.

164
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:26,543
Wait, maybe we don't have
to risk anything on anything.

165
00:06:26,584 --> 00:06:27,700
What are you talking about?

166
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,327
We're talking about
someone close to Bratton

167
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:31,470
who might be able to
stop this thing dead in his trash.

168
00:06:31,502 --> 00:06:32,468
You like Eli Gould.

169
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:34,335
Exactly.
He was Bratton's partner.

170
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:34,954
What's more,

171
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,970
Alex got him on tape admitting that
he committed a disbarrable offense.

172
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,927
Which means, you've been dangling
a sword over his head ever since.

173
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,972
Guess what.
I got the sword right here.

174
00:06:43,013 --> 00:06:45,683
That settles it.
We have our game plan.

175
00:06:45,724 --> 00:06:47,740
Hold on, if this thing
goes to trial,

176
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:49,388
couldn't Bratton
end up in prison?

177
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:50,640
What are you getting at?

178
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:52,898
Why would he risk that
just to get revenge?

179
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:56,060
People do crazy things when they
think they've lost everything.

180
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:57,697
Now, let's get to it.

181
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,769
We've all got something to do.

182
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,967
Samantha, whatever it is,
now is not the time.

183
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:10,392
Too bad. We have a problem,
and his name is Gavin Andrews.

184
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:11,709
Oh, what now with that man?

185
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:13,709
Long story short,
Dexhart Insurance

186
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,712
needs to sue Starboard Airlines.

187
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:17,756
How exactly is that
supposed to happen

188
00:07:17,797 --> 00:07:19,383
when we represent them both?

189
00:07:19,424 --> 00:07:20,638
Why do you think I'm here?

190
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:23,388
Better not be to get me to
tell Alex to drop his client.

191
00:07:23,429 --> 00:07:26,599
Robert, you know Gavin is not worth
the headache. He needs to go.

192
00:07:26,651 --> 00:07:27,945
Here's a better idea.

193
00:07:27,986 --> 00:07:30,032
Since you and Alex
each just lost a client,

194
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,177
these two clients stay.

195
00:07:32,273 --> 00:07:33,273
What?

196
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:36,802
You think I wouldn't find out
about that Rand Kaldor shit?

197
00:07:37,317 --> 00:07:39,076
- Robert, I was going to...
- Listen to me.

198
00:07:39,117 --> 00:07:42,021
This firm is under attack.
We can't do this right now.

199
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,160
What do you mean?

200
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:44,435
That's none of your concern.

201
00:07:44,476 --> 00:07:47,423
But, what is your concern
is fixing this situation.

202
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:50,410
And how do we do that when neither
client is gonna back down?

203
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:51,352
I'll tell you how.

204
00:07:51,393 --> 00:07:53,299
You and Alex stop
acting like children,

205
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,358
get your clients into a room
and get them assembled.

206
00:07:55,398 --> 00:07:57,568
What do you propose we do
when that doesn't work?

207
00:07:57,609 --> 00:07:58,287
Samantha...

208
00:07:58,328 --> 00:08:00,349
instead of taking up
more time that I don't have,

209
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,352
I propose you make it work.

210
00:08:10,653 --> 00:08:11,708
Good morning, Katrina.

211
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:13,242
Can I help you with something?

212
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:15,209
If this conversation
goes as planned,

213
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,100
you're going to be helping
me with a lot of things.

214
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,601
I don't understand.

215
00:08:19,434 --> 00:08:21,102
I just made senior partner.

216
00:08:22,518 --> 00:08:24,373
- So it's official?
- It's official.

217
00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:26,962
And as my first act...

218
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,075
Brian Simon Altman,

219
00:08:29,147 --> 00:08:31,099
will you be my associate?

220
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:33,394
Katrina, I'm honored.

221
00:08:33,435 --> 00:08:35,336
But before I answer,

222
00:08:35,377 --> 00:08:38,257
are you sure the two of us
working so closely together

223
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:39,381
is a good idea?

224
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:41,759
What?

225
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,866
I mean, we've become
good friends.

226
00:08:44,062 --> 00:08:47,358
So it might get complicated
if I officially work for you.

227
00:08:47,867 --> 00:08:49,258
I appreciate that, Brian.

228
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:50,886
But I'm okay with it if you are.

229
00:08:50,954 --> 00:08:54,334
In that case, I would love
to be your associate.

230
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,629
Then I suggest we start with
some ground rules.

231
00:08:56,738 --> 00:08:59,284
First, every day, you get here
before everyone else.

232
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:00,912
- Done.
- Next, power ties only.

233
00:09:00,953 --> 00:09:02,915
Not any of the ties
I have seen you wear.

234
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:04,952
Been meaning to replace
my collection anyway.

235
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:05,993
Finally...

236
00:09:06,053 --> 00:09:07,937
I don't wanna yes man.

237
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:09,967
So I don't care
what the topic is.

238
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,685
If you disagree with me,
I want you to push back,

239
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:14,772
whether it'll
piss me off or not.

240
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,202
Are we clear?

241
00:09:16,243 --> 00:09:19,161
If I say yes to that, that would mean
I'm being a yes man.

242
00:09:19,202 --> 00:09:20,981
So I don't know what to do right now..

243
00:09:21,022 --> 00:09:22,717
I'll tell you
what you're gonna do.

244
00:09:22,758 --> 00:09:25,438
You're gonna help me win the case
that's going to put us on the map.

245
00:09:31,348 --> 00:09:32,602
Hey.

246
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,917
Do you have a second?

247
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,880
Only if you have an hour to go
through that box over there.

248
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:40,206
Actually, I think I may have
a better way to spend my time.

249
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:42,800
Okay. What's going on
in that brain of yours?

250
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:44,066
I didn't want to say it
in the room,

251
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:46,167
but I don't think
Eli Gould is the only person

252
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,420
we should be going to.

253
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,531
We need to pay a visit
to Gallo's daughter.

254
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:52,220
You think she knows
something that can help.

255
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:53,672
I don't know what she knows.

256
00:09:53,713 --> 00:09:54,698
But we better find out.

257
00:09:54,739 --> 00:09:57,237
Because there's a chance
Bratton has her in his pocket.

258
00:09:57,278 --> 00:09:59,950
Who knows what lies he told
to get her. You're right.

259
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:01,964
I'll go right now.

260
00:10:02,005 --> 00:10:04,453
No, no, no. That's what I'm trying
to tell you. It can't be you.

261
00:10:04,493 --> 00:10:07,464
I know you're part of
the firm's leadership, but...

262
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:10,176
Harvey, if Bratton has
convinced her of some bullshit,

263
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,604
it'll be next to impossible
to change her mind.

264
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,275
And the man who put her father
away in the first place

265
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:16,823
isn't the one to do that.

266
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,492
You're right.

267
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:19,995
Do what you can.

268
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,097
Oh, finally.

269
00:10:29,138 --> 00:10:30,307
I've been looking for you.

270
00:10:30,348 --> 00:10:32,227
Why? Got another
lawsuit to drop?

271
00:10:32,335 --> 00:10:34,463
Actually, I have
a settlement to reach.

272
00:10:35,526 --> 00:10:36,738
Are they putting something
in this coffee?

273
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:38,292
It sounds like
you're backing off.

274
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:38,953
Alex...

275
00:10:38,994 --> 00:10:40,047
Robert doesn't want
either one of us

276
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:41,673
losing any more business
right now.

277
00:10:41,745 --> 00:10:44,166
You asked him to make me
drop Gavin. He said no.

278
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,488
The important thing is,
keeping both clients

279
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:48,401
wasn't a request.
It was an order.

280
00:10:48,442 --> 00:10:51,166
Which means we need to figure out
a way to stay out of court.

281
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:52,877
- We do.
- Well...

282
00:10:53,297 --> 00:10:55,842
I'm not selling out my client
just to please Robert saying so.

283
00:10:56,094 --> 00:10:57,510
What exactly are you suggesting?

284
00:10:57,551 --> 00:10:59,213
I'm suggesting
that we do what two people

285
00:10:59,254 --> 00:11:01,666
that like to go to war
sometimes have to do.

286
00:11:01,938 --> 00:11:03,723
Find a way to make peace.

287
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,110
Eli.

288
00:11:10,283 --> 00:11:12,454
I hope you don't mind.
Your wife let me in.

289
00:11:12,495 --> 00:11:13,830
Louis Litt.

290
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:15,666
You've got some balls,
coming to my house.

291
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:16,776
I knew you might not like it,

292
00:11:16,816 --> 00:11:18,853
which is why
I brought you a gift.

293
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:21,392
Is that what I think it is?

294
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:22,585
If you think it's the only

295
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:24,464
copy of the recording Alex
claims made that night,

296
00:11:24,504 --> 00:11:25,924
then yeah, it is.

297
00:11:26,047 --> 00:11:28,300
- I'm offering it to you.
- Why would you do that?

298
00:11:28,652 --> 00:11:30,518
I thought we could
work out an arrangement.

299
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,813
You get Tommy Bratton
to back off his lawsuit,

300
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:35,533
you get back the one thing
that can cost you your license.

301
00:11:35,574 --> 00:11:38,411
What makes you think I'd
help you just to get that back?

302
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:41,085
Eli, I don't think you fully
understand the situation.

303
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,835
We may have forced him out,

304
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:44,788
but his name
is still on your wall.

305
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,124
You take this to court,

306
00:11:46,244 --> 00:11:47,772
you're risking the name
Bratton Gould

307
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:49,858
forever being associated
with corruption and murder.

308
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:52,570
When he convinces a jury
that you fabricated material

309
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:53,864
just to blackmail him,

310
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:55,825
the world's gonna think
you're liars.

311
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:57,995
That little tape of yours
will be worthless.

312
00:11:58,036 --> 00:12:00,124
And the name Bratton Gould
will be just fine.

313
00:12:00,165 --> 00:12:02,418
Eli, you need
to think this through.

314
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:03,569
The man is guilty.

315
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,864
The man was my partner.

316
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:07,858
You cost him millions.

317
00:12:08,023 --> 00:12:10,735
Blackmailed me twice
with that thing already.

318
00:12:11,037 --> 00:12:12,880
And now, you're gonna pay.

319
00:12:12,936 --> 00:12:13,916
Eli, please.

320
00:12:13,957 --> 00:12:15,883
Get the hell out of my house.

321
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:29,370
This is a bunch of bullshit.

322
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:31,248
I take it that means
you're up to speed?

323
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:32,914
I'm not just up to speed,
I know more about

324
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:35,250
women's clothing
than I ever thought possible.

325
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,698
Then you know Hi-Rise Fashion
has been ripping off

326
00:12:37,739 --> 00:12:38,812
our client's designs.

327
00:12:38,853 --> 00:12:39,601
I do.

328
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:42,314
The thing I don't know
is how we're gonna stop them,

329
00:12:42,355 --> 00:12:45,026
because copyright laws
are notoriously vague.

330
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:48,280
Which is why when we win,
it's going to make a statement.

331
00:12:48,927 --> 00:12:52,147
Then since I'm not supposed
to be a yes man, I have to ask.

332
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,491
You sure
you don't want our first case

333
00:12:53,531 --> 00:12:55,131
to be a guaranteed win?

334
00:12:56,717 --> 00:12:59,848
Okay, the truth is, I'm not just
doing this to make a statement.

335
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:02,717
I'm also doing it because
the designer's my friend.

336
00:13:02,858 --> 00:13:04,775
Which means
this case is personal.

337
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:07,238
And I told myself
that when I had enough clout

338
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,781
to pick my cases...

339
00:13:09,095 --> 00:13:10,861
I would pick hers.

340
00:13:11,678 --> 00:13:12,454
In that case,

341
00:13:12,495 --> 00:13:14,665
why don't you tell me
what our first move is?

342
00:13:14,924 --> 00:13:16,261
Easy.

343
00:13:16,302 --> 00:13:18,969
Tomorrow morning,
we slap them with this.

344
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,820
Denise Gallo?

345
00:13:40,603 --> 00:13:41,275
Yeah?

346
00:13:41,332 --> 00:13:42,704
My name's Donna Paulsen.

347
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,415
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

348
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:45,187
About what?

349
00:13:45,228 --> 00:13:47,288
I was wondering if a man named
Thomas Bratton came to you,

350
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:49,393
asking about the money
you received from your father.

351
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:51,923
He came to me, to ask about
the money I got from you.

352
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,092
What'd you tell him?

353
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,821
I don't know what my
father did to get that money.

354
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,713
A man came to my home
and dropped off a check,

355
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,114
and I wasn't about
to turn it down.

356
00:13:59,526 --> 00:14:00,624
And didn't that man also tell you

357
00:14:00,664 --> 00:14:02,118
that your father
was a good person?

358
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,495
So, what if he did?

359
00:14:03,536 --> 00:14:07,083
So these people are trying to say
that we paid him off to lie for us.

360
00:14:07,124 --> 00:14:08,336
And it isn't true.

361
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:10,704
What do you want me
to do about it?

362
00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:13,490
I want you to take
the stand and testify.

363
00:14:13,538 --> 00:14:15,875
Your father died trying
to redeem himself.

364
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,212
They're trying to
take that away from you,

365
00:14:17,252 --> 00:14:18,658
and you can't let them do it.

366
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:20,793
Let's say I believe you,

367
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:22,839
and Frank actually had changed.

368
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:25,074
Thomas Bratton told me
the reason he got killed

369
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,361
is 'cause of you.

370
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:29,106
Are you gonna tell me
that's not true?

371
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:31,328
No.

372
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:33,650
I'm not.

373
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,751
Because they might lie to you,
but I won't.

374
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,903
Frank never would have
tried to redeem himself

375
00:14:40,944 --> 00:14:41,950
if we hadn't contacted him.

376
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,475
So yeah,
he might still be alive.

377
00:14:44,994 --> 00:14:46,498
But the reason he's dead
isn't because of us.

378
00:14:46,538 --> 00:14:48,334
It's because they killed him.

379
00:14:48,635 --> 00:14:50,415
Well, it doesn't matter,

380
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:53,822
'cause I never knew
the man he became.

381
00:14:53,888 --> 00:14:55,183
I only knew the man he was,

382
00:14:55,224 --> 00:14:57,770
and that man
would have lied, cheated,

383
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,802
done whatever else it took
to get what he wanted.

384
00:14:59,843 --> 00:15:01,814
Which, most of the time,
was money.

385
00:15:01,855 --> 00:15:03,550
If you ask me
about that under oath,

386
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:05,295
that's all I'll be able to say.

387
00:15:14,884 --> 00:15:16,659
All right,
Louis, we're all here.

388
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,564
- What's going on?
- It didn't work with Gould.

389
00:15:18,611 --> 00:15:20,467
And I hate to pile on
more bad news,

390
00:15:20,508 --> 00:15:22,678
but if Bratton puts
Denise Gallo on the stand,

391
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:24,290
she's gonna say that Frank Gallo

392
00:15:24,331 --> 00:15:25,753
never did a thing
that wasn't for money.

393
00:15:25,793 --> 00:15:28,130
Which makes it look like
we paid him off to lie.

394
00:15:28,171 --> 00:15:30,299
If we did that,
we'd conspire with each other.

395
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,511
Which means we're right back
at square one.

396
00:15:32,552 --> 00:15:34,264
I wouldn't say that.

397
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,382
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here with an offer.

398
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,899
Give me that tape back,
I'll get him to settle.

399
00:15:40,365 --> 00:15:43,376
Five million, and you two
admit what you did.

400
00:15:43,487 --> 00:15:45,907
- No deal.
- It saves you money.

401
00:15:45,948 --> 00:15:48,661
It also puts us in a position
of losing our licenses.

402
00:15:48,702 --> 00:15:51,439
Which is what he's been holding
over my head for two years.

403
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,142
- I don't give a shit.
- No deal.

404
00:15:53,183 --> 00:15:54,520
Look,

405
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:56,384
I thought about
what you said last night.

406
00:15:56,425 --> 00:15:59,400
But if I'm gonna convince Tommy,
I gotta give him something.

407
00:15:59,472 --> 00:16:01,892
Sign a civil admission,
and we'll seal it.

408
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:04,062
Sealed or not,
we sign something like that,

409
00:16:04,103 --> 00:16:05,940
it finds its way to the bar.

410
00:16:06,236 --> 00:16:07,561
Listen to me.

411
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:11,295
I want this to go away as much
as you, but I'm telling you,

412
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,884
this is the best
you're gonna get.

413
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,944
I hate to say this, but I think
maybe we should take his deal.

414
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:25,721
We can't trust Eli Gould.

415
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,181
And we sure as hell
can't trust Tommy Bratton.

416
00:16:28,222 --> 00:16:29,287
And I think you're forgetting

417
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:30,654
that they may be lying
about the Gallo part,

418
00:16:30,694 --> 00:16:31,960
but you and Robert did
what they're saying.

419
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,557
So what?

420
00:16:32,598 --> 00:16:34,857
So we may have no other choice
than to trust them.

421
00:16:34,898 --> 00:16:36,568
I'm not trusting shit,

422
00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:38,951
because I know
what's going on here.

423
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,123
And it goes back
to Donna's original question.

424
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:43,623
You mean, why would a man
like Tommy Bratton risk prison?

425
00:16:43,831 --> 00:16:45,669
And the answer is, he wouldn't.

426
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,255
This whole thing is
a good cop, bad cop bluff,

427
00:16:48,296 --> 00:16:49,883
and I'm gonna put a stop to it.

428
00:16:49,924 --> 00:16:50,993
How?

429
00:16:51,034 --> 00:16:52,798
The way you put
a stop to any bully.

430
00:16:53,298 --> 00:16:56,314
You take his bluff and you
shove it down his throat.

431
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,343
Those are lovely.

432
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,861
Whose are they?

433
00:17:05,902 --> 00:17:06,759
I'm sorry?

434
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,100
She means, who designed them?

435
00:17:08,229 --> 00:17:09,905
Since we know your people didn't.

436
00:17:09,973 --> 00:17:14,415
Just like they didn't
design this or this or this.

437
00:17:14,472 --> 00:17:16,016
I don't know who you are,

438
00:17:16,057 --> 00:17:18,353
but these items were part
of our last spring line,

439
00:17:18,394 --> 00:17:19,980
and we designed them ourselves.

440
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,443
What you mean is you copied
my client's designs,

441
00:17:22,484 --> 00:17:24,978
then beat her to market
and undercut her price.

442
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:29,091
I see what this is,
because I've seen it before.

443
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,525
And no associate
at some middling law firm

444
00:17:31,566 --> 00:17:32,901
is going to shake me down.

445
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,306
I'm not an associate,
I'm a senior partner.

446
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,702
And this isn't a shakedown. It's
a chance at a settlement before

447
00:17:37,742 --> 00:17:39,365
we clean you out in court.

448
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:41,239
Then file your suit,

449
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,829
because it's a thin line
between theft and inspiration.

450
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,408
Particularly in
a creative industry

451
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,599
where people have
similar ideas all the time.

452
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,995
My lawyers
have assured me of that.

453
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:54,220
Have they also told you about
Johnson v. Olympia Records?

454
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,678
Because a songwriter was awarded
15 million for plagiarized work

455
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:59,353
in exactly the same situation.

456
00:17:59,394 --> 00:18:01,634
And since precedents
can cross industries,

457
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:03,595
in particular
the creative ones...

458
00:18:03,636 --> 00:18:07,224
We thought $15 million for our
client's designs would be fair.

459
00:18:07,389 --> 00:18:09,930
We'll give you 24 hours
to consult your lawyers.

460
00:18:10,395 --> 00:18:12,565
After that,
we'll see you in court.

461
00:18:16,506 --> 00:18:19,320
As your lawyers, it is our job
to go to war for you.

462
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,283
Most of the time,
that means going to court.

463
00:18:21,324 --> 00:18:23,286
The thing is,
court is ugly, expensive,

464
00:18:23,327 --> 00:18:24,706
and most of all, it's risky.

465
00:18:24,766 --> 00:18:26,177
So last night,
Samantha and I came up

466
00:18:26,217 --> 00:18:27,611
with a way to avoid all that.

467
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:31,277
The painting in question had
a market value of 120 million.

468
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,387
Our proposal is that Starboard
Airlines pay 45 percent,

469
00:18:34,428 --> 00:18:36,014
with no admission of fault.

470
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,176
Let me get this straight.

471
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:39,639
You want me to pony up
$50 million dollars

472
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,764
when we didn't do anything?

473
00:18:40,805 --> 00:18:41,933
Gavin, it's a compromise.

474
00:18:41,974 --> 00:18:43,278
There's gotta be pain
on both sides.

475
00:18:43,318 --> 00:18:45,989
That's a lot of pain on mine,
and not enough on theirs.

476
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,554
You've got exposure
for the full 120.

477
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:49,927
So I'd say, you're
getting a hell of a deal.

478
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:51,439
I don't care what you say.

479
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,514
Then I'll say it.

480
00:18:52,555 --> 00:18:54,504
If anybody's coming out
ahead here, it's you.

481
00:18:54,545 --> 00:18:56,286
- And I don't like it.
- Nina, listen to me.

482
00:18:56,326 --> 00:18:57,387
No, I did listen to you.

483
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,432
Two days ago, when you said
this shady son of a bitch

484
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,803
destroyed that painting
intentionally, and you'd prove it.

485
00:19:01,844 --> 00:19:02,811
I don't believe it.

486
00:19:02,852 --> 00:19:03,739
Shady son of a bitch.

487
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,726
Is that how you talk
about your former clients?

488
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:07,187
- Gavin...
- Yeah, that's what she said.

489
00:19:07,227 --> 00:19:09,398
Nina, this deal puts money
on the table now.

490
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,307
You don't take it,
I will appeal this till 2020.

491
00:19:12,348 --> 00:19:14,092
Assuming we don't get it tossed,

492
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:16,233
which we will, knowing what I do

493
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:18,192
about how you and
your company do business.

494
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:20,090
About how I do business?

495
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,124
You gonna let him
push us around like that?

496
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:23,748
Alex, this is a loser for you.

497
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,090
Get your client under control.

498
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,637
Don't tell me how to handle my client
when you started this whole thing.

499
00:19:27,677 --> 00:19:29,678
And don't talk to me about this case
being a loser.

500
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:31,445
- You lucky you're even in here.
- Bullshit.

501
00:19:31,485 --> 00:19:32,663
You're lucky we're in here.

502
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,754
We go to court, and I
will clean your clock.

503
00:19:34,795 --> 00:19:35,408
Bring it on.

504
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:37,744
- If only we could.
- As far as I'm concerned, you can.

505
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:38,878
'Cause I've had enough of this.

506
00:19:38,918 --> 00:19:40,786
You want my money Samantha,
come and take it,

507
00:19:40,827 --> 00:19:43,629
'cause I'm not signing
any deals with anyone.

508
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,439
Harvey, can I talk
to you for a second?

509
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,165
What about?

510
00:19:53,206 --> 00:19:55,041
About the fact that I've had
it with Samantha's bullshit.

511
00:19:55,081 --> 00:19:56,704
Slow down. What's going on?

512
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:58,250
What's going on is,
she deliberately encouraged

513
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,918
Dexhart Insurance
to sue my client.

514
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:01,872
And I'm tired of tip-toeing
around the situation.

515
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:02,489
Meaning?

516
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,220
I wanna go toe-to-toe
with her in trial.

517
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:06,473
You want us to go to trial
representing both clients?

518
00:20:06,563 --> 00:20:08,660
Harvey... I was in a room
with all sides today.

519
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,149
They wanna fight
as much as I do.

520
00:20:10,229 --> 00:20:11,063
They'll waive conflict.

521
00:20:11,104 --> 00:20:14,032
That would work Alex, except we can't
afford having two partners

522
00:20:14,136 --> 00:20:16,432
fighting a death match
in front of the world when...

523
00:20:16,997 --> 00:20:18,509
we need to look unified.

524
00:20:18,581 --> 00:20:20,444
What do you mean,
"we need to look unified"?

525
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:21,514
What's going on?

526
00:20:21,585 --> 00:20:23,704
I don't wanna get into it,
but we're handling it.

527
00:20:23,745 --> 00:20:25,540
Here's the thing Harvey.
We're not unified.

528
00:20:25,581 --> 00:20:28,044
Even if we were,
those two clients aren't gonna settle.

529
00:20:28,274 --> 00:20:30,689
So like it or not,
my next move is going to court

530
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,439
to get her kicked off this case.

531
00:20:37,994 --> 00:20:40,076
Samantha, if you're here
about your case

532
00:20:40,116 --> 00:20:41,283
against Starboard Airlines...

533
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:42,324
You know about that?

534
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:43,781
I'm a name partner.

535
00:20:43,822 --> 00:20:45,721
It's my business to know
when one of our attorneys

536
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:46,744
files suit against another.

537
00:20:46,785 --> 00:20:48,622
While we're on the subject
of filing things,

538
00:20:48,663 --> 00:20:50,542
Alex Williams filed this.

539
00:20:51,478 --> 00:20:53,486
This is a motion to force you
to recuse yourself.

540
00:20:53,527 --> 00:20:55,489
Yeah. He's trying to get me
kicked off my case,

541
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,167
which means you're gonna
kick him off instead.

542
00:20:57,207 --> 00:20:58,877
- Wait, what?
- You heard me.

543
00:20:58,918 --> 00:21:01,494
Alex is gonna drop Gavin.
You're gonna make him do it.

544
00:21:01,535 --> 00:21:03,213
Wow, you want that done,
you go to Robert.

545
00:21:03,254 --> 00:21:04,687
Robert's not here,
and I need it now.

546
00:21:04,727 --> 00:21:06,664
- Well, I can't do it for you.
- You can and you will.

547
00:21:06,704 --> 00:21:08,141
Because you owe me.

548
00:21:08,182 --> 00:21:10,222
Oh, no. You don't get to call in
that chit for this.

549
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:12,373
I get to call it in
for whatever I want,

550
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:15,189
because you came to me
and made me drop Delta,

551
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,900
and then I went against Robert

552
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:19,362
when you wanted back on the case
he took from you.

553
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,637
So we are dropping Gavin Andrews
whether you like it or not.

554
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,858
You come here for the steam?

555
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:38,653
Because I hate to break it to
you, you gotta take the suit off.

556
00:21:38,694 --> 00:21:40,073
That's a good one, Tommy.

557
00:21:40,494 --> 00:21:41,451
But I'm here to tell you

558
00:21:41,492 --> 00:21:42,717
I don't care if you get

559
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:45,551
Eli Gould or Mother Theresa
or Gandhi

560
00:21:45,592 --> 00:21:47,616
to be your good cop.
We're not taking your deal.

561
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,561
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about?

562
00:21:48,602 --> 00:21:49,577
I didn't offer a deal.

563
00:21:49,618 --> 00:21:50,567
Oh, yes, you did,

564
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:52,999
because you don't have the
balls to risk going to prison.

565
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:53,919
That's funny.

566
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,046
What are you gonna say
when I put you on the stand

567
00:21:56,087 --> 00:21:57,538
and ask you point-blank,

568
00:21:57,855 --> 00:22:00,406
"Did you conspire
with Harvey Specter?"

569
00:22:00,447 --> 00:22:03,160
You talk a big game, but
it's not going down like that.

570
00:22:03,201 --> 00:22:05,869
Because I'm gonna say that you
conspired to keep people in prison

571
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,589
for the purpose of lining
your own pockets.

572
00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:09,632
And when you end up
in prison yourself,

573
00:22:09,706 --> 00:22:12,503
every inmate in there is gonna
know that's exactly what you did.

574
00:22:12,544 --> 00:22:14,171
Now who's talking a
big game, Robert?

575
00:22:14,212 --> 00:22:15,212
I am.

576
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,997
Because we're gonna show
this video of Frank Gallo

577
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:19,038
calling you out.

578
00:22:19,207 --> 00:22:21,085
We might even put it up
on YouTube.

579
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:24,053
You're making
a big mistake, Robert.

580
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:26,647
I'm calling your bluff.
So drop this thing.

581
00:22:27,135 --> 00:22:29,645
Or go ahead
and pick a trial date.

582
00:22:29,685 --> 00:22:33,088
But Tommy, just to be clear,
when they close that cell door,

583
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,311
you're not gonna last the night.

584
00:22:42,643 --> 00:22:44,118
Harvey, we need to talk.

585
00:22:44,158 --> 00:22:46,328
If it's about Robert and
Bratton, I haven't heard back yet.

586
00:22:46,368 --> 00:22:48,393
It's not.
It's about Alex and Samantha.

587
00:22:48,822 --> 00:22:51,000
- What did he do now?
- Not him. It's her.

588
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,167
She wants me to make him
drop Gavin Andrews.

589
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:55,111
Then, what the hell
are you doing in here?

590
00:22:55,152 --> 00:22:57,323
- Just tell her no.
- Here's the thing, Harvey.

591
00:22:57,546 --> 00:23:00,416
I gave her a chit.
I owe her. She knows it.

592
00:23:00,457 --> 00:23:01,752
Now I don't know what to do.

593
00:23:02,064 --> 00:23:03,929
- Alex was right.
- What do you mean?

594
00:23:03,969 --> 00:23:06,338
I mean, I've had about enough
of Samantha's bullshit.

595
00:23:06,397 --> 00:23:07,900
So I should sacrifice my honor

596
00:23:07,941 --> 00:23:09,243
and not let her
cash in her chit?

597
00:23:09,284 --> 00:23:11,735
No, Louis, I'm saying
the complete opposite.

598
00:23:21,904 --> 00:23:25,075
Katrina, we've been going over
this all day. We've got them.

599
00:23:25,115 --> 00:23:27,369
- They'll take the deal.
- Maybe they will.

600
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,486
But I am going to keep dotting
my I's and crossing my T's.

601
00:23:30,527 --> 00:23:31,392
I need to be sure.

602
00:23:31,433 --> 00:23:34,334
What you need is for someone
not to be your yes man.

603
00:23:34,374 --> 00:23:35,882
And that starts right now.

604
00:23:35,923 --> 00:23:36,413
Brian...

605
00:23:36,454 --> 00:23:38,725
Katrina, you just
became senior partner.

606
00:23:39,072 --> 00:23:41,717
I bet you haven't even
taken time to celebrate yet.

607
00:23:41,757 --> 00:23:43,639
- I'll celebrate after we win.
- No, you won't.

608
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,847
Because there'll be another case,
then another.

609
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:46,681
And if you don't stop

610
00:23:46,722 --> 00:23:49,477
and appreciate the big moments
when they come...

611
00:23:50,093 --> 00:23:51,426
you'll regret it.

612
00:23:53,017 --> 00:23:54,021
What are you saying?

613
00:23:54,061 --> 00:23:56,236
I'm saying, I'm pulling rank.

614
00:23:56,277 --> 00:23:58,900
We're going out to celebrate,
and we're going out right now.

615
00:24:06,739 --> 00:24:08,077
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

616
00:24:08,117 --> 00:24:10,370
- Whoa Alex, calm down.
- You told my client

617
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,039
we're dropping him,
and you want me to calm down?

618
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,799
You're lucky I'm not
putting you on the floor right now.

619
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:16,569
Listen to me. I had to it.
It was the only way.

620
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,363
The only way to what,
screw me over?

621
00:24:18,404 --> 00:24:19,745
Alex, I owed Samantha.

622
00:24:19,786 --> 00:24:22,077
The only way for me to get out
of it was to do this for her.

623
00:24:22,117 --> 00:24:24,530
- So you put her over me.
- No, I didn't.

624
00:24:24,591 --> 00:24:26,384
Because if she wasn't asking for this,

625
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:29,064
she'd ask me to back her for
name partner when the time comes

626
00:24:29,104 --> 00:24:31,931
instead of me and Harvey backing
you for name partner right now.

627
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,008
You're telling me I'm name partner?
Because I didn't get the memo.

628
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,497
Harvey's going to Zane
as we speak.

629
00:24:35,538 --> 00:24:37,498
Well Louis... the second you put
my name on the door,

630
00:24:37,538 --> 00:24:39,723
I will call Gavin and drop him,
like a hot potato.

631
00:24:39,764 --> 00:24:42,699
Until then, he's my client,
and don't you ever contact him

632
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,119
without my knowledge again.

633
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,481
To ZSL's newest senior partner.

634
00:24:52,522 --> 00:24:54,192
You've already
toasted me four times.

635
00:24:54,233 --> 00:24:57,071
I figured you're new to this
whole celebrating thing.

636
00:24:57,791 --> 00:24:59,545
I wanted to show you
how it's done.

637
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:02,319
Well, in that case...

638
00:25:02,642 --> 00:25:04,729
to ZSL's best associate.

639
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:08,778
Because, Brian, that precedent
was a stroke of genius.

640
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:10,500
Thank you.

641
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,514
By the way...

642
00:25:14,561 --> 00:25:16,110
how did you come up with it?

643
00:25:16,151 --> 00:25:18,237
The music industry
is the perfect parallel,

644
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:19,866
yet no one's ever
thought of it before.

645
00:25:19,907 --> 00:25:22,161
It's actually
a little embarrassing.

646
00:25:22,202 --> 00:25:24,139
What do you mean, embarrassing?

647
00:25:24,287 --> 00:25:26,209
I thought about
the music industry

648
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,880
because I considered
becoming a songwriter myself.

649
00:25:30,265 --> 00:25:31,976
- You're kidding.
- No.

650
00:25:32,017 --> 00:25:34,397
In fact, Julie and I talked
about it a long time

651
00:25:34,438 --> 00:25:36,481
before finally deciding
on law school.

652
00:25:36,755 --> 00:25:37,925
Let me guess.

653
00:25:37,966 --> 00:25:39,960
She wanted you to take
the safer route,

654
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:42,606
and you wanted to explore
your artistic side.

655
00:25:42,647 --> 00:25:44,397
Actually, the other way around.

656
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,574
When I told her
I was gonna be a lawyer,

657
00:25:46,615 --> 00:25:50,035
she said I should have more
faith in myself as an artist.

658
00:25:50,364 --> 00:25:53,280
You're lucky to have someone
who thinks so highly of you.

659
00:25:53,374 --> 00:25:54,499
I am.

660
00:25:54,662 --> 00:25:56,421
But the thing is,
once I moved into law,

661
00:25:56,462 --> 00:25:59,686
I found I loved it as much
as I ever loved writing.

662
00:26:03,318 --> 00:26:04,051
What?

663
00:26:04,092 --> 00:26:05,887
Nothing, it's just...

664
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:09,925
Julie doesn't understand that,
and sometimes, I wish she would.

665
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,817
Anyway, it's nice to be able
to talk about law

666
00:26:13,858 --> 00:26:15,778
with someone
that's actually interested.

667
00:26:16,091 --> 00:26:17,629
If that's what
you're looking for,

668
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,507
consider me happy to discuss
the nuances of the law anytime,

669
00:26:20,586 --> 00:26:23,172
because I love it as much as you do.

670
00:26:24,796 --> 00:26:26,884
Thank you for tonight, Brian.

671
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,270
This was exactly what I needed.

672
00:26:31,024 --> 00:26:33,567
Thanks for asking me
to be your associate, Katrina.

673
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:35,651
I'm really happy you did.

674
00:26:40,652 --> 00:26:42,157
Oh, Harvey, good.

675
00:26:42,444 --> 00:26:44,804
You can help me go through
the last of these files.

676
00:26:44,845 --> 00:26:46,175
I'm not going through anything.
Robert.

677
00:26:46,215 --> 00:26:48,104
Not until we've talked
about Alex Williams.

678
00:26:48,145 --> 00:26:51,018
If this is about what I think it is,
we already talked about it.

679
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:53,760
No, we agreed to kick
the can down the road.

680
00:26:53,801 --> 00:26:55,307
Well, this is the end
of the road,

681
00:26:55,348 --> 00:26:58,561
because Louis and I are backing
Alex for name partner right now.

682
00:26:58,638 --> 00:27:01,229
Harvey, now is not the time
to be discussing this.

683
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:05,018
Yes, it is, because Samantha
and Alex are about to go to war.

684
00:27:05,061 --> 00:27:07,065
If you're talking
about Dexhart Insurance,

685
00:27:07,106 --> 00:27:09,026
- I told her to settle.
- Well, she didn't.

686
00:27:09,487 --> 00:27:11,241
She went to Louis,
called in a chit

687
00:27:11,282 --> 00:27:12,768
to make him drop Gavin Andrews.

688
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:14,688
I didn't let you
become managing partner

689
00:27:14,729 --> 00:27:15,698
just so your lieutenant...

690
00:27:15,739 --> 00:27:17,410
You didn't let me do anything.

691
00:27:17,451 --> 00:27:19,735
And if Samantha did that,
I'll deal with her.

692
00:27:19,776 --> 00:27:20,485
How?

693
00:27:20,661 --> 00:27:22,180
Because as far as I can tell,

694
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,347
you've never dealt with her.

695
00:27:23,387 --> 00:27:24,131
OK... you listen to me.

696
00:27:24,172 --> 00:27:25,401
No, you listen to me.

697
00:27:25,442 --> 00:27:28,012
You let her do whatever she
wants since she got here.

698
00:27:28,053 --> 00:27:30,869
Alex has been fighting for
this firm ever since he got here.

699
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:31,980
And I made him a promise...

700
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,415
Before you two go further,
we've got a bigger problem.

701
00:27:34,879 --> 00:27:37,448
Tommy wasn't bluffing.
He just sent over a trial date.

702
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,401
- It's for a week from today.
- Shit.

703
00:27:39,442 --> 00:27:42,010
Exactly. So you two need
to stop fighting each other,

704
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:43,136
because now we've got
to fight him.

705
00:27:43,176 --> 00:27:45,347
No, we don't. Because I know why
Bratton's doing this.

706
00:27:45,388 --> 00:27:46,547
What are you talking about?

707
00:27:46,588 --> 00:27:48,738
You thought Bratton wouldn't
risk going to prison for this.

708
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:51,337
Well, he will, and I know why.

709
00:27:56,236 --> 00:27:58,908
I don't know about you,
but getting here at 7 a.m.

710
00:27:58,949 --> 00:28:00,409
isn't as easy with a hangover.

711
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,787
I don't care, Brian,

712
00:28:01,828 --> 00:28:04,041
because Hi-Rise Fashion
just dropped a bomb.

713
00:28:04,146 --> 00:28:05,565
Wait, what? How?

714
00:28:05,606 --> 00:28:07,652
- We've got them.
- In court, yes.

715
00:28:07,693 --> 00:28:10,239
But they just cut a huge deal
with our manufacturer.

716
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,315
Suddenly, our manufacturer
is telling us

717
00:28:12,356 --> 00:28:14,667
they no longer have the
capacity to handle our product.

718
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:16,815
You mean they made it
a condition of their order,

719
00:28:16,856 --> 00:28:18,157
which is illegal.

720
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:20,190
Yes, it is.

721
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:22,190
And if they did it to us,
they did it to others.

722
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:24,613
I'm gonna tell them I'm going to
the DOJ if they don't back off.

723
00:28:24,653 --> 00:28:27,010
No, without proof, a threat
like that could be construed

724
00:28:27,051 --> 00:28:29,071
as inducing
malicious prosecution.

725
00:28:29,112 --> 00:28:29,694
You can't do it.

726
00:28:29,735 --> 00:28:31,112
Well, I have to do something.

727
00:28:31,153 --> 00:28:33,174
Because instead of spending
my time last night

728
00:28:33,215 --> 00:28:34,392
thinking about
how to prevent this,

729
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,807
I took my eye off the ball.

730
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:37,899
Katrina, don't be so hard
on yourself.

731
00:28:38,464 --> 00:28:40,343
You couldn't
have seen this coming.

732
00:28:40,384 --> 00:28:41,801
I might have seen it coming

733
00:28:41,842 --> 00:28:44,392
if I'd stayed here
like I wanted to instead of...

734
00:28:44,487 --> 00:28:47,021
letting you convince
me to go party.

735
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:52,985
Hold on a second.
You're saying this is my fault?

736
00:28:53,711 --> 00:28:56,174
Because I didn't convince you,
I invited you.

737
00:28:56,261 --> 00:28:59,265
And you said you wanted an
associate who would push back.

738
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:02,686
Push back on case work.
Not tell me not to do my job.

739
00:29:02,727 --> 00:29:04,178
Then let me push back right now,

740
00:29:04,219 --> 00:29:05,847
because you bluff these guys,

741
00:29:05,888 --> 00:29:07,850
you're opening yourself up
to huge exposure.

742
00:29:07,983 --> 00:29:09,155
So what?

743
00:29:09,477 --> 00:29:11,105
Harvey Specter
bluffs all the time.

744
00:29:11,146 --> 00:29:13,905
Harvey Specter has
a 15-plus-year track record

745
00:29:13,946 --> 00:29:15,490
of kicking people's asses.

746
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:17,992
So you don't have faith in me
to pull this off.

747
00:29:18,032 --> 00:29:18,936
I didn't say that.

748
00:29:18,977 --> 00:29:21,392
I'm saying it's not a risk
worth taking,

749
00:29:21,433 --> 00:29:23,186
and I'm not gonna let you do it.

750
00:29:23,227 --> 00:29:25,898
Well, Brian,
there's a time to push back

751
00:29:25,939 --> 00:29:27,334
and a time to get in line.

752
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:28,918
I'm going there
at 3 p.m. today,

753
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:31,113
and you are either
with me or you're not.

754
00:29:31,154 --> 00:29:32,448
Then I'm not,

755
00:29:32,489 --> 00:29:35,411
because this is a mistake,
and you know it.

756
00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:44,973
Harvey, you have a minute?

757
00:29:45,014 --> 00:29:46,726
I'm about to file a few motions.

758
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:48,058
But, yeah, I have a minute.

759
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:49,397
I was under the impression

760
00:29:49,438 --> 00:29:50,809
you don't normally file
your own motions.

761
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:53,269
Well, it's kind of important.
What's on your mind?

762
00:29:53,514 --> 00:29:55,059
Trouble in senior partner town?

763
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:56,572
How'd you know?

764
00:29:56,613 --> 00:29:57,958
Because that's the first thing
that happens

765
00:29:57,998 --> 00:29:59,832
after you make it
to senior partner town.

766
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:03,634
Well, then, long story short,

767
00:30:04,016 --> 00:30:07,082
it's my first case,
my back's against the wall,

768
00:30:07,123 --> 00:30:09,173
and my only way out is to bluff.

769
00:30:09,311 --> 00:30:11,034
- But?
- I'm opening myself up

770
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:12,511
to significant exposure,

771
00:30:12,552 --> 00:30:13,879
and...

772
00:30:14,097 --> 00:30:16,535
I'm not sure I can pull it off.

773
00:30:17,504 --> 00:30:19,352
Then think of another way out.

774
00:30:19,494 --> 00:30:20,560
How come?

775
00:30:20,813 --> 00:30:23,571
Because if you're not sure
you can pull it off, you won't.

776
00:30:23,612 --> 00:30:25,449
And Katrina, life is long.

777
00:30:25,503 --> 00:30:28,341
You don't want to start senior
partnership with exposure.

778
00:30:28,382 --> 00:30:30,633
Now... I got to go.

779
00:30:31,655 --> 00:30:33,191
Thank you, Harvey.

780
00:30:40,025 --> 00:30:43,156
I see they're letting
you use your old office.

781
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:45,855
First Robert, now you.

782
00:30:45,896 --> 00:30:47,541
Well, he had his turn at bat.

783
00:30:47,582 --> 00:30:49,308
We thought it was time
for me to have mine.

784
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:50,727
Go ahead, take your best shot.

785
00:30:50,768 --> 00:30:52,298
Like I told Robert,

786
00:30:52,438 --> 00:30:53,147
I'm not bluffing.

787
00:30:53,188 --> 00:30:54,524
That's the thing, Tommy.

788
00:30:54,565 --> 00:30:56,793
We know you're not.
We figured out why.

789
00:30:56,834 --> 00:30:58,411
You don't know what
you're talking about.

790
00:30:58,451 --> 00:31:00,163
Yes, I do.

791
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:03,663
Turns out three months ago,
you were diagnosed with cancer

792
00:31:03,704 --> 00:31:05,082
and given a year to live.

793
00:31:05,123 --> 00:31:07,293
Well, if you know that,
then you also know

794
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:08,613
I'm never going to settle.

795
00:31:08,654 --> 00:31:12,243
What I know is what our
trial strategy's gonna be.

796
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:13,913
Motion to delay,

797
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,746
motion to delay,

798
00:31:15,787 --> 00:31:17,207
motion to delay.

799
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,727
The wheels of justice
turn slowly, Tommy.

800
00:31:19,768 --> 00:31:22,585
Which means even if you win,
you won't be here to see it.

801
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:24,602
You really are a son
of a bitch, aren't you?

802
00:31:24,643 --> 00:31:26,121
No. You did this.

803
00:31:26,162 --> 00:31:29,503
You brought this on yourself.
It's time to let it go.

804
00:31:29,544 --> 00:31:32,501
Spend what time you have left
with your family.

805
00:31:32,762 --> 00:31:35,517
Just let me go back to my firm
for nine months more,

806
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:36,621
and I will drop this.

807
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:39,602
I can't let you do that
because I've seen what you do.

808
00:31:39,855 --> 00:31:42,026
I'm not gonna let you
get back in the game

809
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,095
and do something like this
to someone else.

810
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,109
Then you know what?

811
00:31:46,165 --> 00:31:47,828
Delay all you want.

812
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:50,828
Because they say when you're
fighting something like I am,

813
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:52,747
you have to have something
to live for.

814
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:55,584
Well, you just gave me two years
to live on hate alone.

815
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:58,422
Now, get the hell out of here,
and I'll see you in court.

816
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,206
That looks like a job
for your associate.

817
00:32:13,394 --> 00:32:15,332
If you're just here
to talk me out of my bluff,

818
00:32:15,373 --> 00:32:16,942
you don't have to worry.
I'm not gonna do it.

819
00:32:16,982 --> 00:32:17,982
Good.

820
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:20,595
Because you don't have to.

821
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,972
I don't believe it.

822
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:34,353
You got proof they colluded
with our manufacturer.

823
00:32:34,394 --> 00:32:35,738
I did.

824
00:32:36,282 --> 00:32:37,883
Brian, how did you get this?

825
00:32:37,924 --> 00:32:39,566
Simple. I called up the factory,

826
00:32:39,607 --> 00:32:42,802
pretending to be in Hi-Rise's
contracts department

827
00:32:42,843 --> 00:32:44,688
and started complaining
about how all we had

828
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:47,602
were verbal assurances
they'd uphold our agreement.

829
00:32:47,651 --> 00:32:50,280
Eventually, they agreed
to sign a memo.

830
00:32:50,438 --> 00:32:52,365
They agreed to
incriminate themselves?

831
00:32:52,446 --> 00:32:56,425
Not exactly. I told them copyright
laws are notoriously vague,

832
00:32:56,466 --> 00:32:58,511
so their memo could be too.

833
00:32:58,567 --> 00:33:02,183
But even a vague memo is enough
for us to get them investigated.

834
00:33:02,224 --> 00:33:03,601
Or threaten to.

835
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:05,454
But now...

836
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,798
you can do it with proof.

837
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,816
Did it occur to you

838
00:33:10,857 --> 00:33:12,738
that misrepresenting yourself
like this

839
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:14,722
could have opened you up
to huge exposure?

840
00:33:14,903 --> 00:33:16,364
It did.

841
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,527
But I decided
it was worth the risk.

842
00:33:18,568 --> 00:33:21,277
Because my job may be
to push back,

843
00:33:21,318 --> 00:33:23,644
but it's also to have your back.

844
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:26,823
And from now on, I will.

845
00:33:30,483 --> 00:33:33,063
Two more years on hate alone.

846
00:33:34,104 --> 00:33:35,253
He said that?

847
00:33:35,294 --> 00:33:37,923
He not only said it,
the son of a bitch meant it.

848
00:33:37,964 --> 00:33:40,510
He's gonna fight us
until his last breath.

849
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:42,542
What?

850
00:33:43,092 --> 00:33:46,263
A man gets told he only has so
much time left on this earth,

851
00:33:46,304 --> 00:33:48,325
you would think that would
put things in perspective.

852
00:33:48,365 --> 00:33:49,826
You would.

853
00:33:50,666 --> 00:33:52,909
But I guess
he'd have to be human.

854
00:33:54,144 --> 00:33:57,543
And as it turns out,
he was more like the Terminator.

855
00:33:57,584 --> 00:33:59,421
Just won't go down.

856
00:33:59,733 --> 00:34:02,779
Come with me if you want to live.

857
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,782
I'll be back.

858
00:34:04,823 --> 00:34:08,055
Hasta la vista, baby.

859
00:34:08,622 --> 00:34:10,578
If it bleeds, we can kill it.

860
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:11,955
First of all, that's Predator.

861
00:34:11,995 --> 00:34:13,751
Second of all,
you sound Jamaican.

862
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:14,960
Not German.

863
00:34:15,025 --> 00:34:17,601
Oh, man. Get off my back, man.

864
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,679
You know what?
He's Austrian.

865
00:34:21,864 --> 00:34:23,220
Yeah.

866
00:34:27,346 --> 00:34:28,766
What are we gonna do?

867
00:34:29,323 --> 00:34:30,913
We're gonna do what we have to.

868
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,437
We're gonna delay this
as long as possible,

869
00:34:33,478 --> 00:34:34,953
and then fight it on its merits.

870
00:34:34,994 --> 00:34:37,078
We don't have to
fight anything anymore.

871
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,734
Tommy Bratton's dead.

872
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,684
What?

873
00:34:41,725 --> 00:34:43,270
Eli Gould just called.

874
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:45,064
He said Tommy
had a heart attack.

875
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:49,276
They think it was brought on by the
stress of fighting his illness.

876
00:34:49,561 --> 00:34:51,520
And fighting us.

877
00:34:52,635 --> 00:34:54,431
Anyway, for what it's worth,

878
00:34:54,472 --> 00:34:56,118
Gould's dropping
the whole thing.

879
00:34:56,811 --> 00:34:58,541
I gotta say, I
always thought we'd win.

880
00:34:58,581 --> 00:34:59,959
But not like this.

881
00:35:00,385 --> 00:35:02,302
Robert, you okay?

882
00:35:04,121 --> 00:35:05,498
I don't know.

883
00:35:07,868 --> 00:35:10,165
We may have been at war, but...

884
00:35:10,695 --> 00:35:13,299
I knew the man for 30 years.

885
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,673
I could use a minute
to process this.

886
00:35:21,527 --> 00:35:23,741
You take all the time you need.

887
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:38,414
How'd it go?

888
00:35:40,792 --> 00:35:42,420
I didn't know you like baseball.

889
00:35:42,461 --> 00:35:44,423
I didn't know you like music.

890
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,152
You heading home for the night?

891
00:35:46,193 --> 00:35:48,989
- Yeah. Actually...
- Don't go yet.

892
00:35:49,505 --> 00:35:53,188
Brian, you came through for me
in every way on this case.

893
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,500
And like you said
the other night,

894
00:35:55,541 --> 00:35:57,586
if we don't stop to celebrate
the little things,

895
00:35:57,627 --> 00:35:59,213
then what's any of this for?

896
00:35:59,931 --> 00:36:02,086
I didn't know any better,
I'd say this is your way

897
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:03,208
of thanking me...

898
00:36:03,852 --> 00:36:05,110
for looking out for you.

899
00:36:05,151 --> 00:36:06,430
It is.

900
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:08,399
And I happen to have
made us reservations

901
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,516
at an amazing place
with live music

902
00:36:10,557 --> 00:36:12,141
in honor of your love of music.

903
00:36:12,182 --> 00:36:14,061
Katrina, I can't tonight.

904
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,471
I really need to get home
with Julie and the baby.

905
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:18,512
Oh.

906
00:36:19,234 --> 00:36:20,312
The baby. Of course.

907
00:36:20,362 --> 00:36:22,491
I'm sorry, I didn't
think about it.

908
00:36:22,633 --> 00:36:23,772
No, it's okay.

909
00:36:23,813 --> 00:36:25,930
If you don't have one, why
would you think about it?

910
00:36:25,971 --> 00:36:27,641
Right.

911
00:36:28,168 --> 00:36:31,797
But let me just say that I would
love to get a rain check.

912
00:36:33,196 --> 00:36:34,491
Rain check it is.

913
00:36:34,532 --> 00:36:36,241
In the meantime, I gotta go.

914
00:36:38,177 --> 00:36:40,774
I'm sure you have someone else
who would love to take my place.

915
00:36:40,815 --> 00:36:42,055
Oh, of course.

916
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,576
Have a good night, Brian.

917
00:36:45,772 --> 00:36:47,066
Good night, Katrina.

918
00:36:53,701 --> 00:36:54,996
Am I interrupting?

919
00:36:55,122 --> 00:36:56,686
- Not really.
- Good.

920
00:36:56,727 --> 00:36:59,774
Because... I happened to have walked
in on a conversation last night

921
00:36:59,815 --> 00:37:01,758
that made me wanna have
a conversation with you.

922
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:02,948
I'm listening.

923
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:04,579
This...

924
00:37:05,064 --> 00:37:08,188
thing between you and Alex
is coming to a head.

925
00:37:08,229 --> 00:37:10,983
Harvey and Louis want Alex
to be the next name partner

926
00:37:11,024 --> 00:37:12,367
and Robert doesn't.

927
00:37:12,408 --> 00:37:14,746
Skip the preamble, Donna.
What's on your mind?

928
00:37:14,967 --> 00:37:16,556
I don't suppose it would
do any good to ask you

929
00:37:16,596 --> 00:37:19,055
to let this go and let Alex
go up there first.

930
00:37:19,096 --> 00:37:20,640
- I don't believe it.
- Believe what?

931
00:37:20,681 --> 00:37:22,204
That Harvey doesn't have
the balls to come in here

932
00:37:22,244 --> 00:37:24,430
and ask me himself.
Instead he sent you.

933
00:37:24,471 --> 00:37:26,501
He didn't send anybody.
I'm here on my own.

934
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:27,728
Well then you may have internalized

935
00:37:27,768 --> 00:37:29,897
the patriarchal system here,
but I have not.

936
00:37:29,938 --> 00:37:31,727
I haven't internalized anything.

937
00:37:31,768 --> 00:37:34,022
I told you I'm not here
at the behest of any man.

938
00:37:34,063 --> 00:37:36,525
I'm here on my own,
woman to woman,

939
00:37:36,566 --> 00:37:38,716
asking you to take
the long view and wait.

940
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,302
I'm sure you think that's true.

941
00:37:40,343 --> 00:37:42,742
But did it occur to you
to ask Alex to step down

942
00:37:42,783 --> 00:37:43,782
before you came to me?

943
00:37:43,823 --> 00:37:46,110
Because that's what I mean
by patriarchy.

944
00:37:46,151 --> 00:37:48,039
I did think to ask Alex.

945
00:37:48,108 --> 00:37:49,653
And I chose to ask you.

946
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:51,881
And I did that
because it comes down

947
00:37:51,922 --> 00:37:54,176
to who the promise
was made to first.

948
00:37:54,217 --> 00:37:56,346
Not the gender of the person
it was made to.

949
00:37:56,533 --> 00:37:58,411
What's to stop them
from changing their minds

950
00:37:58,452 --> 00:37:59,873
before it's my turn?

951
00:37:59,914 --> 00:38:01,646
Because they're not gonna
put a second name up there

952
00:38:01,686 --> 00:38:03,354
for at least another year.

953
00:38:05,104 --> 00:38:07,041
What if they put it in writing?

954
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:09,704
You're a lawyer.
You make it airtight.

955
00:38:10,854 --> 00:38:12,484
You really make a person
get to the bottom

956
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,319
of what's inside of them,
don't you?

957
00:38:14,787 --> 00:38:17,307
- What do you mean?
- When you put it that way,

958
00:38:17,348 --> 00:38:18,955
it's not about them
changing their minds,

959
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:19,932
or it taking too long,

960
00:38:19,973 --> 00:38:21,861
or even Robert
getting hit by a bus.

961
00:38:22,157 --> 00:38:25,635
The truth is,
I'm not backing down because...

962
00:38:26,946 --> 00:38:29,242
I think I'm better than
Alex Williams.

963
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:31,691
And I'm not gonna say
that I'm not.

964
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,143
Then I respect your decision.

965
00:38:36,317 --> 00:38:37,650
Good night, Samantha.

966
00:38:44,634 --> 00:38:45,838
Hey.

967
00:38:48,455 --> 00:38:50,314
I heard you won your first case.

968
00:38:50,355 --> 00:38:51,823
And the fact that I
already heard about it

969
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:53,694
means you're making a name
for yourself.

970
00:38:53,735 --> 00:38:55,111
So...

971
00:39:02,094 --> 00:39:03,554
Thank you, Louis.

972
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:06,848
Wait a second.
Is something wrong?

973
00:39:06,951 --> 00:39:08,675
Goddamn it, did they spell
Bennett with one T again?

974
00:39:08,715 --> 00:39:10,018
No. Nothing's wrong.

975
00:39:10,065 --> 00:39:11,065
It's...

976
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:13,547
just been a long
day, and I'm tired.

977
00:39:16,877 --> 00:39:19,560
Katrina... ahem... I know you.

978
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:21,040
You don't get tired
after winning a case.

979
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,581
Something is going on.

980
00:39:25,547 --> 00:39:28,814
It's just, I know
I should be happy right now.

981
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,932
I finally made it
to the top of the mountain.

982
00:39:31,973 --> 00:39:33,011
I get it.

983
00:39:33,052 --> 00:39:35,962
It only made you realize how much
further you still want to go.

984
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,211
Yes, that's it.

985
00:39:38,725 --> 00:39:40,726
That's exactly it.

986
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,617
No, it's not it.

987
00:39:43,736 --> 00:39:46,346
I have seen that look before,
and it was on my face.

988
00:39:46,404 --> 00:39:47,613
Katrina...

989
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,255
when it comes
to that part of life...

990
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,063
you can't force it.

991
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,560
It's unpredictable.

992
00:39:58,532 --> 00:40:01,912
- I hate unpredictable.
- I know. I do too.

993
00:40:02,257 --> 00:40:03,319
But...

994
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,455
you once told me that someday,

995
00:40:05,496 --> 00:40:07,164
I would find someone.

996
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,727
And I did.

997
00:40:10,082 --> 00:40:11,626
And you will too.

998
00:40:11,972 --> 00:40:13,916
Life is gonna put
that special someone

999
00:40:13,957 --> 00:40:16,128
right in front of you,
and when it happens,

1000
00:40:16,183 --> 00:40:18,225
I know you'll be ready.

1001
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,913
Hey, I just realized,

1002
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:25,370
I never took you out
to celebrate your promotion.

1003
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:27,496
What do you say we go out
and get dinner right now?

1004
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,158
Another time, Louis.

1005
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:31,080
I have some work to catch up on.

1006
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:54,498
Drinking alone?

1007
00:40:54,937 --> 00:40:56,999
I guess what they say is true.

1008
00:40:57,172 --> 00:41:00,096
None of us know
how much time we really have.

1009
00:41:00,229 --> 00:41:01,898
No, we don't.

1010
00:41:02,204 --> 00:41:04,260
Listen, Robert,
I've been doing some thinking

1011
00:41:04,301 --> 00:41:06,472
about the Samantha
and Alex situation.

1012
00:41:06,513 --> 00:41:09,432
Harvey, not tonight.
Just hear me out, please.

1013
00:41:12,995 --> 00:41:15,034
I think we should
let them fight.

1014
00:41:15,591 --> 00:41:18,471
Harvey, we do that, we're
admitting our house is divided.

1015
00:41:18,729 --> 00:41:21,946
And we make it that much easier
for another Tommy Bratton

1016
00:41:21,987 --> 00:41:23,549
to try and pick us apart.

1017
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,729
I know.

1018
00:41:25,385 --> 00:41:26,980
But our house is divided.

1019
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:30,941
I made a promise.
You made a promise.

1020
00:41:30,982 --> 00:41:32,652
And if we keep doing nothing...

1021
00:41:32,693 --> 00:41:35,410
It's worse than letting them
settle it themselves.

1022
00:41:36,343 --> 00:41:38,679
One case, head-to-head.

1023
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,512
Winner gets name partner.

1024
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:42,672
You think they'll go for it?

1025
00:41:42,713 --> 00:41:44,084
I think they've been
wanting to go at it

1026
00:41:44,124 --> 00:41:45,749
ever since you two got here.

1027
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,216
Then I say we let them fight.

1028
00:41:54,156 --> 00:41:56,076
You want to tell them,
or should I?

1029
00:41:56,117 --> 00:41:58,246
Why don't we both tell them?

1030
00:41:58,287 --> 00:41:59,707
But let's do it tomorrow.

1031
00:42:00,065 --> 00:42:00,894
Because after today,

1032
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,481
all I wanna do is
finish this drink,

1033
00:42:03,928 --> 00:42:05,584
go home, and...

1034
00:42:06,402 --> 00:42:08,066
see Laura.

1035
00:42:12,535 --> 00:42:14,328
Good night, Robert.

1036
00:42:19,515 --> 00:42:21,100
Good night, Harvey.
