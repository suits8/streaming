1
00:00:01,025 --> 00:00:02,199
<i>Previously, on "Suits..."</i>

2
00:00:02,223 --> 00:00:03,436
One of my transport flights

3
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:06,098
was carrying some art.
The hull depressurized,

4
00:00:06,141 --> 00:00:07,664
and one of the pieces
got damaged.

5
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:09,251
It had to be insured,
so what's the problem?

6
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:10,600
The insurance inspector's got
the balls to say

7
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:12,321
they'd be suing me
for the damages.

8
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:14,169
I made an appointment with
the top fertility specialist

9
00:00:14,193 --> 00:00:16,021
in the country.
- You really think

10
00:00:16,064 --> 00:00:17,737
we need a specialist?
- The sooner we get some help,

11
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:19,676
the sooner we can hold
that baby in our arms.

12
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,698
Two days ago, when you said
this shady son of a bitch

13
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:23,332
destroyed that painting
intentionally--

14
00:00:23,376 --> 00:00:24,788
Is that how you talk
about your former clients?

15
00:00:24,812 --> 00:00:26,727
Alex, this thing
is a loser for you.

16
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,618
- Get your client under control.
- Don't talk to me

17
00:00:28,642 --> 00:00:30,185
about this case being a loser.
You're lucky we're even

18
00:00:30,209 --> 00:00:31,688
in here.
- Bullshit.

19
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:33,603
We go to court
and I will clean your clock.

20
00:00:33,647 --> 00:00:35,320
Samantha and Alex
are about to go to war.

21
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:37,346
- I told her to settle.
- Well, she didn't.

22
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,653
And if Samantha did that,
I'll deal with her.

23
00:00:39,696 --> 00:00:41,089
How?
Because you've let her do

24
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:42,830
whatever she wants
ever since she got here.

25
00:00:42,873 --> 00:00:44,353
I don't suppose
it would do any good

26
00:00:44,397 --> 00:00:45,852
to ask you to let
Alex go up there first.

27
00:00:45,876 --> 00:00:47,356
I'm not backing down because

28
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,184
I think I'm better
than Alex Williams,

29
00:00:49,228 --> 00:00:50,751
and I'm not gonna say
that I'm not.

30
00:00:50,794 --> 00:00:52,187
You have some
cervical fibroids

31
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:54,102
that, unfortunately,
your OB missed,

32
00:00:54,146 --> 00:00:56,385
and I'd like to remove them.
- If we keep doing nothing...

33
00:00:56,409 --> 00:00:58,672
It's worse than letting them
settle it themselves.

34
00:00:58,715 --> 00:01:02,067
One case, head-to-head,
winner gets name partner.

35
00:01:04,156 --> 00:01:05,200
As you both know,

36
00:01:05,244 --> 00:01:06,854
Harvey and I each made
a promise

37
00:01:06,897 --> 00:01:09,074
to put your names
on the door next.

38
00:01:09,117 --> 00:01:10,790
And obviously it's not
possible for us both

39
00:01:10,814 --> 00:01:12,338
to keep that promise.

40
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:14,142
This better not be you
telling us we're going up

41
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,168
at the same time, because as
far as I'm concerned,

42
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:17,797
that's as bullshit as telling
me you're giving it to him.

43
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:19,823
And for once,
you and I agree.

44
00:01:19,867 --> 00:01:23,131
Good, because we
have another idea.

45
00:01:23,175 --> 00:01:24,413
Are those what
I think they are?

46
00:01:24,437 --> 00:01:26,134
Two conflict
of interest waivers

47
00:01:26,178 --> 00:01:27,329
giving you the green light
to take off the gloves

48
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:28,745
and get in the ring.

49
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,182
You wanted a fight.
You got it.

50
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:31,792
The winner gets
their name up next.

51
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:33,881
Any questions?

52
00:01:33,924 --> 00:01:35,143
I got one.

53
00:01:35,187 --> 00:01:36,294
Is it gonna be "and Williams,"

54
00:01:36,318 --> 00:01:37,885
or just "Zane Specter
Litt Williams"?

55
00:01:37,928 --> 00:01:40,192
I can answer that.
It's not gonna be either one.

56
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:41,299
Then I guess we'll
just have to find out.

57
00:01:41,323 --> 00:01:42,759
I guess we will.

58
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:43,867
Well, before you start
taking any swings,

59
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:45,240
I wanna make one thing clear:

60
00:01:45,284 --> 00:01:47,373
This is a fair fight.

61
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:48,809
No using inside information.

62
00:01:48,852 --> 00:01:50,854
No looking at the other
person's shit.

63
00:01:50,898 --> 00:01:52,204
Are we clear?

64
00:01:52,247 --> 00:01:53,466
- Yes.
- Clear.

65
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:56,817
And if no one else
is gonna say it, I will.

66
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,775
Let's get ready to rumble.

67
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,700
Harvey. What are you doing here?

68
00:02:10,744 --> 00:02:13,442
I came to say I know this
isn't how either of us

69
00:02:13,486 --> 00:02:15,183
thought this would go down.

70
00:02:15,227 --> 00:02:17,838
And I wanted to make sure
you were good with it.

71
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:19,405
If this is what
it's gonna take,

72
00:02:19,448 --> 00:02:20,754
then I'm not just
good with it.

73
00:02:20,797 --> 00:02:22,712
I'm also good with this.

74
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:24,279
Let me guess.

75
00:02:24,323 --> 00:02:25,474
You want me to take
care of this for you.

76
00:02:25,498 --> 00:02:26,953
It's nothing you
haven't done before.

77
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:28,327
What happened to

78
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,782
you don't like it
when I get involved?

79
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:31,175
What I don't like is you
getting involved

80
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,437
when I asked you
to stay out of it.

81
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:34,376
This is me telling you
to get your ass in it.

82
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,725
All right, Alex.

83
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:37,379
Are you sure?

84
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,227
Because once I do this,
there's no taking it back.

85
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:40,295
Yes, I'm sure.

86
00:02:40,339 --> 00:02:41,818
Because I guarantee you,

87
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:43,951
she's going to Robert
to do the same damn thing.

88
00:02:43,994 --> 00:02:47,737
So the question is,
are you here for me or not?

89
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:51,306
I'm here for you, Alex.
I'm right the hell here.

90
00:02:59,532 --> 00:03:01,882
- Good, you're here.
- No.

91
00:03:01,925 --> 00:03:03,338
What do you mean no?
You don't even know

92
00:03:03,362 --> 00:03:04,885
what I want.
- Bullshit, I don't.

93
00:03:04,928 --> 00:03:06,863
You're here for some kind
of edge with Alex Williams,

94
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,236
and I'm not gonna
give it to you.

95
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,846
- Why not?
- Because if I step in

96
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,848
to help you, it undermines
the whole arrangement.

97
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:14,547
All I'm asking is to
delay the trial a week.

98
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,375
Samantha, I'm managing
partner here because

99
00:03:16,418 --> 00:03:19,247
I stayed out when it was time.
Well, it's still time.

100
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,249
And if you wanna
delay this thing,

101
00:03:21,293 --> 00:03:22,574
you're gonna have
to do it on your own.

102
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:23,923
- That is bullshit.
- And you're entitled

103
00:03:23,947 --> 00:03:25,297
to your opinion.

104
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,839
Now, unless you got
some other business,

105
00:03:26,863 --> 00:03:28,952
why don't you just let me
wash my hands in peace?

- Same here.

120
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:23,745
Banker or lawyer?

121
00:04:25,225 --> 00:04:27,227
What I am is not interested.

122
00:04:27,271 --> 00:04:28,794
Well, you might
not be interested,

123
00:04:28,837 --> 00:04:30,424
but you're going to listen.
Now, we can be formal

124
00:04:30,448 --> 00:04:34,278
about this, Samantha,
or you can just call me Tom.

125
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:39,370
Okay, Tom.
I'm listening.

126
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,110
We know there's money
laundering going on

127
00:04:41,154 --> 00:04:43,330
in your firm,
but we don't know how high up

128
00:04:43,374 --> 00:04:45,245
the food chain it goes.

129
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:48,117
And the bureau thinks that
you'd be the perfect person

130
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:49,684
to help us answer
that question.

131
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:51,164
- Why me?
- We know that you served

132
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,339
your country once before.

133
00:04:52,383 --> 00:04:53,906
This is a chance
to serve it again.

134
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:55,492
Well, you can wave the
flag all you want,

135
00:04:55,516 --> 00:04:57,692
but I don't know anything,
and I'm loyal to the people

136
00:04:57,736 --> 00:04:59,303
I'm in the foxhole with
right now.

137
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:01,217
Well, if you're not
gonna ask what you can do

138
00:05:01,261 --> 00:05:03,307
for your country, then...

139
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,832
maybe you should ask what
your country can do to you.

140
00:05:11,402 --> 00:05:13,360
- These records were sealed.
- They were.

141
00:05:13,404 --> 00:05:17,451
And whether they stay sealed
is entirely your choice.

142
00:05:17,495 --> 00:05:19,192
See what you can dig up,

143
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,325
and don't say a word
about this to anyone.

144
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:37,863
You don't usually come
in and sit right down.

145
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:39,884
- This must be important.
- I need to say something

146
00:05:39,908 --> 00:05:41,780
about this trial,
and I need you to hear me.

147
00:05:41,823 --> 00:05:43,869
Donna, if this is about
us not consulting you,

148
00:05:43,912 --> 00:05:46,480
it was a name partner decision.
- It's not about that, Harvey.

149
00:05:46,524 --> 00:05:48,830
I'm here to talk about what
we're gonna do when it's over.

150
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:50,417
- What do you mean?
- We're all still gonna

151
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:52,268
be here, and win or lose,
it's gonna be on you

152
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:53,792
to keep the peace.

153
00:05:53,835 --> 00:05:55,533
I hope you're asking
the same of Zane.

154
00:05:55,576 --> 00:05:57,361
- I'm not.
- Why not?

155
00:05:57,404 --> 00:05:58,903
Because this is still more
your firm than his,

156
00:05:58,927 --> 00:06:00,755
and everybody knows it.

157
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:02,801
So if Alex wins,

158
00:06:02,844 --> 00:06:05,194
you need to be
magnanimous about it.

159
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:07,936
And Harvey, if Samantha wins,
you need to be the bigger man

160
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,504
and accept it with grace.

161
00:06:10,548 --> 00:06:13,246
You don't think Alex can win,
do you?

162
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,422
- What if I said I don't?
- I'd wanna know why.

163
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:17,990
Because this isn't about
who the better lawyer is.

164
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:19,774
It's about winning.

165
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:21,404
And unless he suddenly becomes
a different person,

166
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:23,996
he's not willing to go
as far as she is to win.

167
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:26,520
Well then maybe he is
becoming a different person.

168
00:06:26,564 --> 00:06:28,392
- What do you mean?
- I mean he came to me

169
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:30,916
for help, and he wasn't asking.
He was telling.

170
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,570
- And you gave it to him?
- I did.

171
00:06:32,613 --> 00:06:34,591
Harvey, if Alex comes to you
asking for help again,

172
00:06:34,615 --> 00:06:36,443
say no.
- Why?

173
00:06:36,487 --> 00:06:39,446
Because this isn't just about
keeping the peace later.

174
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,535
If we're not careful,
this could rip us apart

175
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:43,450
before it's even over.

176
00:06:50,414 --> 00:06:51,937
What's all this?

177
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,871
Just wanted to make sure you
had all of our discovery.

178
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:55,569
You're bringing me
a cartload of documents

179
00:06:55,593 --> 00:06:57,812
to go through at 9:00 at night?

180
00:06:57,856 --> 00:06:59,553
And this is just the tip
of the iceberg.

181
00:06:59,597 --> 00:07:01,425
You might wanna order takeout.

182
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:03,514
How much of this is purely
to waste my time?

183
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:06,473
I'll leave that to you,
but speaking of time...

184
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:09,998
I don't believe it!

185
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:11,609
You moved the trial
to tomorrow?

186
00:07:11,652 --> 00:07:12,977
I don't run the four corners,
Samantha.

187
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:14,307
I fast-break.

188
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,830
And right now, it's show time.

189
00:07:15,874 --> 00:07:17,919
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

190
00:07:17,963 --> 00:07:19,593
You're trying to speed this
thing up because you know

191
00:07:19,617 --> 00:07:21,923
your client is guilty,
just like you know

192
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:24,012
if I have time to dig in,
I'll prove it.

193
00:07:24,056 --> 00:07:25,599
I'm trying to speed this up
because the longer

194
00:07:25,623 --> 00:07:27,276
this goes on,
the longer my client's image

195
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,539
gets dragged through the mud.

196
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:30,410
Spare me the song
and dance, Alex.

197
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:31,866
The judge might not
have seen through it, but I do.

198
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,500
You're right.
He did see it my way.

199
00:07:33,544 --> 00:07:35,478
And the only thing you're gonna
see is me wiping the floor

200
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:37,417
with you starting tomorrow.

201
00:07:45,556 --> 00:07:46,948
- Yeah?
- Louis.

202
00:07:46,992 --> 00:07:48,559
Hey, I was just
thinking about you.

203
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,386
What's going on?
How was your day?

204
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,954
Well, I've got some good
news and some bad news.

205
00:07:52,998 --> 00:07:54,956
- What happened?
- Dean Stanton's wife

206
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,610
was diagnosed
with breast cancer,

207
00:07:56,654 --> 00:07:59,483
and he's stepping down
to spend some time with her.

208
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:01,354
Sheila, I am so sorry.

209
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,487
The good news
is he recommended me

210
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,401
to be interim dean.

211
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:07,075
Oh, my God, that's amazing.
I'm gonna come home right now

212
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:08,579
and we're gonna go out
and celebrate.

213
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,102
Louis, you don't have
to do that.

214
00:08:10,145 --> 00:08:11,645
Well, I know I don't have to.
I want to.

215
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:13,627
No, I mean,
you don't have to do that.

216
00:08:13,671 --> 00:08:15,716
Because I'm already here.

217
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,504
I am so proud of you.

218
00:08:20,547 --> 00:08:22,114
Louis, it hasn't
happened yet.

219
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:24,072
It will.

220
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:27,554
I know it will.

221
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:39,392
Excuse me, Mr. Jarvis.
Do you have a minute?

222
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,526
Of course I do.
But first I'll need a name.

223
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:44,005
Samantha Wheeler.

224
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:47,052
Well, Samantha Wheeler,
what can I do for you?

225
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:49,509
When I was hired I was told I
could come to senior management

226
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:51,360
with anything.
- And you can.

227
00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:53,362
We pride ourselves
on our reputation

228
00:08:53,406 --> 00:08:55,451
for looking after
our associates.

229
00:08:55,495 --> 00:08:57,628
Which is why I'm hoping
you can help me.

230
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,717
I was approached
by the FBI this morning.

231
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,023
They think something's
going on here.

232
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:03,547
Oh.

233
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,158
And, well, what did you say?

234
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:08,160
I said I'm loyal to my firm.

235
00:09:08,203 --> 00:09:09,944
Well, that would presume
there's something

236
00:09:09,988 --> 00:09:11,598
to be loyal about.

237
00:09:11,642 --> 00:09:13,513
The guy that came
at me believes

238
00:09:13,557 --> 00:09:14,775
we're laundering money.

239
00:09:16,777 --> 00:09:18,431
What are you working
on right now?

240
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,650
The suit against Monsanto.

241
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,390
First thing tomorrow,
I'm farming it out

242
00:09:21,434 --> 00:09:23,654
to someone else,
because if the FBI's right,

243
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:27,048
then I need someone
to dig into our books.

244
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:29,398
If I go to accounting, then
whoever's doing this is gonna

245
00:09:29,442 --> 00:09:32,967
know there's something
rotten in Denmark.

246
00:09:33,011 --> 00:09:34,708
- I'm on it.
- Good.

247
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:38,582
Oh, and Samantha,
if you find anything,

248
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:42,542
I mean, no matter how small,
please, let me know.

249
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:51,682
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're going to hear a lot

250
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,988
of numbers in this trial,
but the only number

251
00:09:54,032 --> 00:09:55,990
that matters is seven.

252
00:09:56,034 --> 00:09:59,559
That's how many safeguards
there are to keep a cargo hold

253
00:09:59,603 --> 00:10:02,997
from depressurizing.
It simply can't happen.

254
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:06,131
Unless someone wants
it to happen.

255
00:10:06,174 --> 00:10:09,743
20 years ago, I parked my car
outside a 7-Eleven.

256
00:10:09,787 --> 00:10:12,093
When I came out,
it was totaled,

257
00:10:12,137 --> 00:10:14,618
and it took me two years
to collect $1,800

258
00:10:14,661 --> 00:10:16,445
I couldn't afford to lose.

259
00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:19,100
Gavin Andrews stood to gain
millions of dollars

260
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:20,774
from destroying the very
painting he was charged

261
00:10:20,798 --> 00:10:22,190
with transporting.

262
00:10:22,234 --> 00:10:24,149
Now, imagine
it wasn't a Corolla.

263
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:25,759
It was a $100 million painting.

264
00:10:25,803 --> 00:10:27,761
Think how hard they'll
fight not to pay.

265
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:29,676
Because it's what
insurance companies do.

266
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,245
They blame someone else.
They call it an act of God.

267
00:10:33,288 --> 00:10:35,726
Or they just say, "Screw you.
Come and get it."

268
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,119
The truth is,
this is a crime,

269
00:10:38,163 --> 00:10:40,121
and he should go
to prison for it.

270
00:10:40,165 --> 00:10:42,036
Unfortunately we can't put him
away for this,

271
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,039
but what we can do
is make him pay for it.

272
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,086
Because they'll do whatever
it takes to keep their money.

273
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:50,828
And we're not gonna let
them get away with it.

274
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:55,049
Miss Wheeler,
your first witness.

275
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:58,531
Your Honor, I call
Gavin Andrews to the stand.

276
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,098
I guess you aren't
big on foreplay.

277
00:11:00,141 --> 00:11:01,795
Oh, I like foreplay
just fine, Alex.

278
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,275
But you're right
about one thing.

279
00:11:03,318 --> 00:11:04,711
You're about to get ----ed.

280
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,673
Mr. Andrews,
when a plane depressurizes,

281
00:11:09,716 --> 00:11:11,544
the NTSB is supposed
to investigate.

282
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,068
But before they could,
you cleared out the cargo hold.

283
00:11:14,112 --> 00:11:15,766
Why would you do that?

284
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,265
Because you don't leave
million-dollar works of art

285
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:19,160
to bake in the sun.

286
00:11:19,204 --> 00:11:20,747
And thanks to my call, we were
able to save most of them.

287
00:11:20,771 --> 00:11:22,294
Most of them.

288
00:11:22,337 --> 00:11:23,861
But not the Vermeer.

289
00:11:23,904 --> 00:11:26,080
And if there's one less
Vermeer in the world,

290
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:27,734
then yours in more valuable.

291
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:29,518
Sorry to disappoint you,
but I didn't want

292
00:11:29,562 --> 00:11:31,105
that painting destroyed.
I wanted to buy it.

293
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:32,783
Then let's talk
about your other art.

294
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:36,177
Five years ago, you bought
a Renoir for $8 million

295
00:11:36,221 --> 00:11:38,963
and recently sold it.
Is that correct?

296
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,967
- It is.
- How much did you sell it for?

297
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:45,752
- Considerably more.
- Isn't it true

298
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:48,886
you sold it for $55 million

299
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:51,845
to an airline manufacturer
who then happened

300
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:53,542
to win your business?
- Your Honor,

301
00:11:53,586 --> 00:11:54,868
that's a violation of
the terms of our waiver.

302
00:11:54,892 --> 00:11:56,545
She's using
privileged information.

303
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:58,722
It would be privileged,
except Mr. Andrews' wife

304
00:11:58,765 --> 00:12:01,115
detailed all of this
in their divorce filing.

305
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,117
- What?
- He hid assets

306
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:04,815
from their
prenuptial agreement.

307
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,208
He took bribes and hid them
as art transactions--

308
00:12:07,252 --> 00:12:08,340
Hearsay, Your Honor.

309
00:12:08,383 --> 00:12:10,124
Allegations from
a bitter ex-wife.

310
00:12:10,168 --> 00:12:11,928
A woman who knows this man
better than anyone.

311
00:12:11,952 --> 00:12:13,606
Overruled, Mr. Williams.

312
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,739
Divorce filings
are publicly available.

313
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:18,611
Mr. Andrews, you take
kickbacks from your suppliers.

314
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,265
You cheated your own wife.

315
00:12:20,308 --> 00:12:22,571
Do you really expect a jury
to believe what happened

316
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:25,357
to the Vermeer was an accident?
- It was an accident.

317
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,769
Well, actions speak
louder than words.

318
00:12:26,793 --> 00:12:28,577
And your actions
aren't just speaking.

319
00:12:28,621 --> 00:12:30,754
They are screaming that you're
guilty

320
00:12:30,797 --> 00:12:33,234
and all of these people
can hear it.

321
00:12:46,617 --> 00:12:49,097
God damn it,
we had an agreement,

322
00:12:49,141 --> 00:12:50,727
and you broke it.
- I didn't break anything.

323
00:12:50,751 --> 00:12:52,555
Don't give me that shit.
There's no public record

324
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:53,730
of that divorce filing,
and there's no way his wife

325
00:12:53,754 --> 00:12:55,190
knew about that $55 million.

326
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:57,062
Then go check
the filing yourself.

327
00:12:57,105 --> 00:12:59,107
I think you'll find that
it's been recently amended

328
00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:00,500
and placed in
the public record,

329
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:02,067
which means I didn't
violate anything.

330
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,417
All right, Samantha.
You want public record.

331
00:13:04,461 --> 00:13:08,552
I'll give you public record.

332
00:13:08,595 --> 00:13:10,555
Ms. Horford, instead
of looking at the whole chain

333
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:13,165
of custody, you only
focused on Starboard Airlines.

334
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,080
Why is that?

335
00:13:15,123 --> 00:13:16,753
We looked at the whole chain
of custody, Mr. Williams.

336
00:13:16,777 --> 00:13:18,562
For how long?
Ten minutes?

337
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:20,390
An hour?

338
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:21,802
Or just long enough to figure
that of all the people

339
00:13:21,826 --> 00:13:24,655
you could sue, Gavin Andrews
had the deepest pockets?

340
00:13:24,698 --> 00:13:27,005
That's insulting.
We don't do business that way.

341
00:13:27,048 --> 00:13:28,746
I think you do,
which is why you lost

342
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:31,052
Starboard Airlines as a client
when Gavin Andrews took

343
00:13:31,096 --> 00:13:33,011
his business elsewhere.
- That has nothing

344
00:13:33,054 --> 00:13:34,423
to do with this.
- It has to do with you

345
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,014
missing out on your bonus
that year.

346
00:13:36,057 --> 00:13:37,600
If you're implying that
I would use my company

347
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:39,147
for personal reasons--

348
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:41,256
Isn't that what you're
accusing my client of doing?

349
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,587
And when an analyst at Goldman
asked you why you lost

350
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,719
Starboard Airlines,
you said,

351
00:13:45,763 --> 00:13:47,741
"The way Gavin Andrews does
business will come back

352
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:49,593
to haunt him,"
meaning you would come back

353
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:51,048
to haunt him.
- That's not what I meant.

354
00:13:51,072 --> 00:13:52,639
It sure sounds
like what it meant.

355
00:13:52,683 --> 00:13:55,163
What I meant was that our
biggest rival gave him

356
00:13:55,207 --> 00:13:57,035
a kickback to drop--
- You have proof of that?

357
00:13:57,078 --> 00:14:00,038
No, you don't, just like you
don't have proof that my client

358
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:01,779
damaged that painting.

359
00:14:01,822 --> 00:14:04,042
All you have is a bunch
of smear tactics and a grudge.

360
00:14:04,085 --> 00:14:06,436
- Objection, testifying--
- Then I'll wrap it up.

361
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,799
Because you were right: actions
do speak louder than words.

362
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:12,050
And all this is is a good old
fashioned case of payback.

363
00:14:22,234 --> 00:14:23,864
I came home as soon
as I got the voicemail.

364
00:14:23,888 --> 00:14:25,542
I got the job.

365
00:14:25,585 --> 00:14:28,066
Sheila, that is fantastic.
I am so proud of you.

366
00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:30,460
And not only that,
they said if I do well,

367
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,505
I can have it permanently.

368
00:14:34,202 --> 00:14:36,117
- Permanently?
- Yes.

369
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:37,641
They were discussing it,

370
00:14:37,684 --> 00:14:39,404
and the head of the search
committee said...

371
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:42,535
Louis, what's wrong?
- Nothing, it's just we agreed

372
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:45,866
after the baby, I'd do the
heavy lifting in the fall,

373
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,173
and you would take over after
recruiting season ended.

374
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:49,870
The dean of a law school,
Sheila,

375
00:14:49,914 --> 00:14:51,306
that's a year-round job.

376
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,849
There's no way you'll
be able to do both.

377
00:14:52,873 --> 00:14:55,093
Well, we can--we
can make an adjustment.

378
00:14:55,136 --> 00:14:58,183
- What kind of adjustment?
- Well, I don't know.

379
00:14:58,226 --> 00:15:01,099
Don't most couples with
full-time jobs get a nanny?

380
00:15:01,142 --> 00:15:02,729
I don't want a stranger
raising my child.

381
00:15:02,753 --> 00:15:04,537
So you want me to turn down
an opportunity

382
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:06,541
that may never come again?
- Not the interim part,

383
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,498
but the permanent part, yes.

384
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,214
Louis, if I did that
and we have a daughter,

385
00:15:10,238 --> 00:15:12,197
how would I ever look
her in the eye?

386
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,827
You look at her in the eye
and you tell her,

387
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:16,114
"I chose you."

388
00:15:16,157 --> 00:15:18,812
If you don't, you'll never be
able to look her in the eye

389
00:15:18,856 --> 00:15:20,727
at all because
you'll be working.

390
00:15:20,771 --> 00:15:23,600
Okay, that's not fair, Louis.

391
00:15:23,643 --> 00:15:24,881
And if we worked out
the Jewish thing,

392
00:15:24,905 --> 00:15:26,211
we can work this out.

393
00:15:26,254 --> 00:15:27,865
Well, we haven't figured
that out yet.

394
00:15:27,908 --> 00:15:29,823
And that was something
we hadn't discussed.

395
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:31,303
This is something we agreed on.

396
00:15:31,346 --> 00:15:33,131
Like when we agreed you'd
give up mudding,

397
00:15:33,174 --> 00:15:34,891
and then you didn't.
- Don't throw that back on me.

398
00:15:34,915 --> 00:15:36,806
I lived up to it in the end.
- Okay, well this is a little

399
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:40,181
bit bigger than mudding, Louis.
This is my life.

400
00:15:40,225 --> 00:15:42,357
And I want this job
and I want a baby

401
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,925
and I don't see why
I can't have both.

402
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:47,319
Well, I don't know
what to say to all that.

403
00:15:47,362 --> 00:15:50,844
How about,
"I support your choices?"

404
00:15:50,888 --> 00:15:53,673
Because I'm gonna have surgery
in three days to help us

405
00:15:53,717 --> 00:15:55,719
have this baby.

406
00:15:55,762 --> 00:15:57,895
And I'd feel a lot better
about it knowing we were

407
00:15:57,938 --> 00:16:01,725
both on the same team.

408
00:16:16,348 --> 00:16:17,697
Robert.

409
00:16:17,741 --> 00:16:19,264
Samantha.

410
00:16:19,307 --> 00:16:20,831
What are you doing down here?

411
00:16:20,874 --> 00:16:22,920
There was an error
with a client's billing.

412
00:16:22,963 --> 00:16:24,922
I'm trying to fix it
before it gets noticed.

413
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:26,358
Which client?
Maybe I can help.

414
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:29,274
I appreciate that.
I just took care of it.

415
00:16:29,317 --> 00:16:31,319
- Have a nice night.
- Samantha.

416
00:16:31,363 --> 00:16:33,931
There's only two reasons
someone who's not an accountant

417
00:16:33,974 --> 00:16:35,759
would be here
on a Friday night.

418
00:16:35,802 --> 00:16:38,588
Either they can't get a date,
or...

419
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,633
they want to be here
when no one's around.

420
00:16:40,677 --> 00:16:41,939
What are you saying?

421
00:16:41,982 --> 00:16:43,264
You're not here
to fix something.

422
00:16:43,288 --> 00:16:44,898
You're here to find something.

423
00:16:44,942 --> 00:16:48,946
- That's not what I'm do--
- It's okay.

424
00:16:48,989 --> 00:16:50,774
I'm here for the same thing.

425
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,430
There's something shady going
on here with the money.

426
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:56,910
I just can't prove it.

427
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:02,786
Let's say I trust you.
What have you found so far?

428
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:04,352
- There's two issues.
- Bonus payments

429
00:17:04,396 --> 00:17:06,267
and retainer fees.
- Exactly.

430
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:07,834
So I tell you what.

431
00:17:07,878 --> 00:17:09,967
You take the retainers.
I'll take the bonuses.

432
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,665
A week from now, we meet up
and see what's what.

433
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:15,015
Sounds like a plan.

434
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,021
Robert, why are you doing this?

435
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:23,241
Because I don't mind
defending criminals,

436
00:17:23,284 --> 00:17:26,461
but I didn't put myself through
law school to work for them.

437
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:41,389
All right, you wanted help.

438
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:43,000
Well, here it is.

439
00:17:43,043 --> 00:17:45,742
What I wanted
was help yesterday.

440
00:17:45,785 --> 00:17:48,309
You said no,
and now it's too late.

441
00:17:48,353 --> 00:17:51,486
- The trial's already started.
- Well, I was wrong.

442
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,314
So you can hold a grudge,
or you can think

443
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:55,490
of something else.

444
00:17:58,406 --> 00:18:00,757
All right.

445
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,020
There is one thing.

446
00:18:03,063 --> 00:18:06,023
After Alex tore Nina
to pieces on the stand,

447
00:18:06,066 --> 00:18:08,373
I told her we needed
to shore up the investigation

448
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,854
into the packing company.

449
00:18:10,897 --> 00:18:13,421
- She got a look on her face.
- What kind of look?

450
00:18:13,465 --> 00:18:14,834
- The kind of look that said
I'm not gonna be able

451
00:18:14,858 --> 00:18:16,033
to shore up anything.

452
00:18:16,076 --> 00:18:17,425
So I said, "Forget I asked."

453
00:18:17,469 --> 00:18:18,949
Let me guess.
She already sent

454
00:18:18,992 --> 00:18:20,428
the files over.

455
00:18:20,472 --> 00:18:22,866
I'm pretty sure they
got here after I got back.

456
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:25,303
But I don't know
since I didn't look.

457
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:28,872
Which means you need me
to make that box disappear.

458
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:32,484
- Yes, I do.
- Samantha...

459
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:33,877
let me ask you one question:

460
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,837
are you sure
Gavin Andrews is guilty?

461
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:40,884
Robert, I represented
the man for years.

462
00:18:40,927 --> 00:18:42,494
He is always guilty.

463
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:44,322
Then consider it gone.

464
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:04,467
- 10:00, right on schedule.
- I'm nothing if not prompt.

465
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,252
- So, what'd you come up with?
- Not a thing.

466
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:09,994
- The retainers all checked out.
- Shit.

467
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:11,953
Why shit?

468
00:19:11,996 --> 00:19:16,044
Well, I dug into the bonuses
and struck out, too.

469
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:17,654
Maybe there's nothing to find.

470
00:19:17,697 --> 00:19:20,352
I didn't say I didn't
find anything, Robert.

471
00:19:20,396 --> 00:19:22,441
I said the retainers
all checked out.

472
00:19:22,485 --> 00:19:24,617
After I went down my path,
I went down yours,

473
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:26,445
and wouldn't you know?

474
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:29,318
It led right back to you.

475
00:19:29,361 --> 00:19:31,015
So tell me, Robert.

476
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:35,019
Why am I holding a $100,000
off-the-books wire transfer

477
00:19:35,063 --> 00:19:36,716
with your name on it?

478
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:44,420
Six months ago I found out
all three named partners

479
00:19:44,463 --> 00:19:45,943
were laundering money.

480
00:19:45,987 --> 00:19:48,554
They offered to cut me in.
I said no.

481
00:19:48,598 --> 00:19:51,296
They put that money in there
to make me look complicit.

482
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,906
- Bullshit.
- It's not bullshit.

483
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,102
They wouldn't take the money
back no matter what I said.

484
00:19:55,126 --> 00:19:57,650
So I did the next best thing
and gave it to charity.

485
00:19:57,694 --> 00:19:59,913
If you don't believe me,
I'll show you the check.

486
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:02,066
So you can cut a check
but you can't blow the whistle?

487
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,352
How noble.

488
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:04,353
It's more
complicated than that.

489
00:20:04,396 --> 00:20:05,919
Seems pretty simple to me.

490
00:20:05,963 --> 00:20:08,357
You witness a crime,
you tell the authorities.

491
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,489
Which is what I'm
gonna do right now.

492
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:13,101
Why don't you try telling me
that after you have a daughter?

493
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:26,375
Her name is Rachel.

494
00:20:29,117 --> 00:20:31,075
She wants to be a lawyer.

495
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:33,947
But how is that gonna go when
she applies to the bar

496
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:36,124
and they say, "Isn't
your father a criminal?"

497
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,951
You show them the check

498
00:20:37,995 --> 00:20:39,712
and make them believe
you're not a criminal.

499
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:44,697
If this comes out,
my name is tainted forever.

500
00:20:44,741 --> 00:20:46,482
They'll never believe me.

501
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:48,962
And if it was just me,
I'd take that chance.

502
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:50,616
I'm sorry, Robert.
It's...

503
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,010
- It's not my call.
- Please.

504
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:55,162
Now, you came in here because
you wanted to hear my side

505
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:56,709
of the story.

506
00:20:56,753 --> 00:20:58,624
My story...

507
00:20:58,668 --> 00:21:01,062
is I'm a father
with a daughter.

508
00:21:04,587 --> 00:21:07,068
And I need your help.

509
00:21:15,772 --> 00:21:17,426
Samantha.

510
00:21:17,469 --> 00:21:18,794
I was wondering when
this visit was coming.

511
00:21:18,818 --> 00:21:20,516
- What visit is that?
- The one where

512
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,518
you threaten me.
- I'm not here to threaten you.

513
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:24,800
I'm here to offer you a way out
before publicly humiliating you

514
00:21:24,824 --> 00:21:26,609
because you're still
a client of my firm.

515
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,001
Get off my property.

516
00:21:28,045 --> 00:21:29,153
And I do that,
the jury's gonna hear

517
00:21:29,177 --> 00:21:31,396
from Phillip Jones.

518
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,442
You thought you could
hide him from me.

519
00:21:33,485 --> 00:21:35,008
I don't know anyone
by that name.

520
00:21:35,052 --> 00:21:37,141
Funny, because he has
security footage showing you

521
00:21:37,185 --> 00:21:38,751
meeting with him two weeks
before

522
00:21:38,795 --> 00:21:40,144
you destroyed that painting.

523
00:21:40,188 --> 00:21:42,451
- He'll never testify.
- He already has.

524
00:21:42,494 --> 00:21:44,757
I have him under oath saying
you specifically asked him

525
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:46,194
how much your Vermeer
would go up

526
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:49,022
if another one got destroyed.

527
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:51,068
I've got you, Gavin,
and I am not letting go.

528
00:21:51,112 --> 00:21:53,026
This is illegal
and inadmissible.

529
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,465
- You hacked my shit.
- What I did was do to you

530
00:21:56,508 --> 00:21:58,119
what I used to do for you.

531
00:21:58,162 --> 00:22:00,773
And you can threaten me
or throw me off your property

532
00:22:00,817 --> 00:22:01,774
but once we're
in that courtroom,

533
00:22:01,818 --> 00:22:04,690
I am not going anywhere.

534
00:22:07,258 --> 00:22:09,782
Give me a day.

535
00:22:09,826 --> 00:22:11,654
Excuse me?

536
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:13,482
I'll pay what we owe.
I just--I need a day

537
00:22:13,525 --> 00:22:14,633
to get the board's approval.

538
00:22:14,657 --> 00:22:15,832
No, I don't trust you.

539
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,616
You don't need to trust me.
You got me.

540
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,053
Like you just said.

541
00:22:20,097 --> 00:22:21,490
I'm still a client of the firm.

542
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:22,813
That's gotta count
for something.

543
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,667
- It doesn't.
- Samantha, please.

544
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,799
I know you once told me
about your family.

545
00:22:26,843 --> 00:22:28,627
Well, I have a family and...

546
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:32,085
If this comes out,
think about what it's gonna do

547
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:34,067
to my kids.

548
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:40,161
One day.
I'll give you one day.

549
00:22:40,204 --> 00:22:41,660
And then I'm putting you
on the stand.

550
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:51,650
Louis, what's going on?

551
00:22:51,694 --> 00:22:53,217
What do you mean?

552
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:54,847
I just found a bouquet
of pink carnations on my desk.

553
00:22:54,871 --> 00:22:57,110
And since we both know that's
the widely accepted bouquet

554
00:22:57,134 --> 00:23:00,224
of apology I thought I'd ask
what you're apologizing for.

555
00:23:00,268 --> 00:23:02,835
I wasn't apologizing to you.
I was apologizing to Sheila.

556
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:04,533
It turns out, she didn't
want an apology.

557
00:23:04,576 --> 00:23:05,838
She wanted a change of heart.

558
00:23:05,882 --> 00:23:07,536
And you just made
senior partner,

559
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:09,253
so I thought rather
than throw them away...

560
00:23:09,277 --> 00:23:10,713
Thank you, Louis.

561
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,237
But I thought you and Sheila
were doing great.

562
00:23:13,281 --> 00:23:15,128
Yeah, we were until she got
offered to be the dean

563
00:23:15,152 --> 00:23:17,110
of Columbia Law School.

564
00:23:17,154 --> 00:23:18,523
And you're afraid
if she takes it,

565
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:20,157
she won't have time
for the baby.

566
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:22,681
Exactly, and with this added
responsibility, Katrina,

567
00:23:22,725 --> 00:23:24,857
I...

568
00:23:24,901 --> 00:23:26,903
I don't know how
it's gonna work.

569
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:31,821
I know it's not my place.

570
00:23:31,864 --> 00:23:35,825
But did you consider that
if Sheila has less time,

571
00:23:35,868 --> 00:23:37,740
you might be able
to make more time?

572
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,133
Katrina, I can't
just leave the firm.

573
00:23:40,177 --> 00:23:42,135
I know that, Louis,
but three nights ago,

574
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:44,137
you came into my office
and said you saw a look

575
00:23:44,181 --> 00:23:46,749
on my face that you had
seen on yours before.

576
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,707
Yes, the look of wishing
for someone to share

577
00:23:48,751 --> 00:23:50,231
your life with.

578
00:23:50,274 --> 00:23:52,233
You don't have
that look anymore.

579
00:23:52,276 --> 00:23:55,888
What you do have
is two name partners

580
00:23:55,932 --> 00:23:58,587
and a new senior partner who
have your back.

581
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,284
Which means that when
the time comes,

582
00:24:00,328 --> 00:24:02,678
you'll be able to step back
a little and trust

583
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:05,855
that the firm is in good hands.

584
00:24:08,292 --> 00:24:10,207
Speaking of keeping
the firm in good hands,

585
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:12,165
Katrina, I need
to tell you something.

586
00:24:17,606 --> 00:24:18,911
Gavin, what are
you doing here?

587
00:24:18,955 --> 00:24:20,304
We're due in court in an hour.

588
00:24:20,348 --> 00:24:22,175
No we're not,
because Samantha asked

589
00:24:22,219 --> 00:24:23,936
for a recess and she got it.
- What does she have now?

590
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,179
Doesn't matter what she has.
It matters what I have.

591
00:24:26,223 --> 00:24:28,269
- What is that?
- A list of ethical violations

592
00:24:28,312 --> 00:24:30,334
Samantha Wheeler engaged in
over the course of six years

593
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:31,837
as my attorney.
- No, I'm not ruining

594
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:33,337
Samantha's career.
- Look, you don't have to

595
00:24:33,361 --> 00:24:35,276
ruin anything.
You threaten to take this

596
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:36,625
to the bar and she'll cave.

597
00:24:36,668 --> 00:24:37,819
I'm not gonna
take that chance.

598
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:39,758
And we don't need to.
We're winning.

599
00:24:39,802 --> 00:24:42,283
No, Alex, we're not.

600
00:24:42,326 --> 00:24:43,762
What are you talking about?

601
00:24:43,806 --> 00:24:45,677
Samantha came
to my house this morning.

602
00:24:45,721 --> 00:24:47,742
She has proof that I asked
an appraiser what would happen

603
00:24:47,766 --> 00:24:50,813
to the value of my Vermeer if
that painting got destroyed.

604
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,834
- Now, if he gets on the stand--
- Let me get this straight.

605
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,923
There's a goddamn smoking gun,
and you kept it from me?

606
00:24:54,947 --> 00:24:56,273
'Cause you're a Boy Scout,
and you would've

607
00:24:56,297 --> 00:24:57,994
given it to her.
- All right, look.

608
00:24:58,037 --> 00:24:59,928
It's bad, but it's not proof.
We can cross examine

609
00:24:59,952 --> 00:25:01,606
this guy and--
- Let me make myself clear!

610
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,391
This is not a suggestion.
It is an order.

611
00:25:03,434 --> 00:25:05,958
If you don't use this, I will.
And if I do it, Alex,

612
00:25:06,002 --> 00:25:08,221
we're gonna skip the part
where she gets the chance

613
00:25:08,265 --> 00:25:10,374
to walk away because I'll
be going straight to the bar.

614
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,368
I don't like that
look on your face.

615
00:25:24,412 --> 00:25:26,022
- What look?
- The look that says

616
00:25:26,065 --> 00:25:27,850
you're about to tell me
some serious shit.

617
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,939
Samantha's got Gavin
by the balls.

618
00:25:29,982 --> 00:25:32,245
But I think I got a way out.

619
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:34,030
- How?
- I did some digging.

620
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:36,032
Dexhart has 80%
of the reinsurance

621
00:25:36,075 --> 00:25:37,923
for the packing company
that should have protected

622
00:25:37,947 --> 00:25:39,688
that painting.
- Which means

623
00:25:39,731 --> 00:25:41,448
they'd have incentive
to clear them of any fault.

624
00:25:41,472 --> 00:25:43,648
Which I believe they did
with a false report.

625
00:25:43,692 --> 00:25:45,409
And you think Samantha's
hiding the real report?

626
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:47,019
I think she's too smart
to look at the real report

627
00:25:47,043 --> 00:25:48,697
in the first place.

628
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,283
And I know if we ask for it
with a subpoena,

629
00:25:50,307 --> 00:25:52,004
it'll never see
the light of day.

630
00:25:52,048 --> 00:25:54,267
What exactly are you
here to ask me, Alex?

631
00:25:54,311 --> 00:25:56,289
I want you to get Katrina
Bennett to go over there

632
00:25:56,313 --> 00:25:58,315
and ask for the unredacted
version of that report.

633
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,708
- No way.
- Harvey.

634
00:25:59,751 --> 00:26:01,033
You're asking to have
one of our lawyers

635
00:26:01,057 --> 00:26:02,667
commit a crime.
- It's not a crime.

636
00:26:02,711 --> 00:26:04,277
She's a senior partner
at this firm.

637
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:06,038
All she has to do is say that,
ask for the files,

638
00:26:06,062 --> 00:26:07,866
and get the hell out.
- And if it's so innocent,

639
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,346
why don't you go over there
and do it yourself?

640
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,738
Because I'm not blonde
and no one's gonna

641
00:26:10,762 --> 00:26:12,024
mistake me
for Samantha Wheeler.

642
00:26:12,068 --> 00:26:13,785
Damn it, Alex,
you said you could beat her.

643
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:15,854
I can beat her.
This is what it's gonna take.

644
00:26:15,898 --> 00:26:17,290
And I wouldn't be
in this position

645
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:18,442
if you didn't break your
promise to me.

646
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:19,989
And that's bullshit
because you said

647
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,488
you were good with fighting
to get your name up.

648
00:26:21,512 --> 00:26:24,036
What the hell
was I supposed to say?

649
00:26:27,475 --> 00:26:30,869
Alex, helping to speed up
the trial is one thing.

650
00:26:30,913 --> 00:26:33,959
Putting Katrina at risk?

651
00:26:34,003 --> 00:26:36,048
- I'm not doing it.
- Then you should know,

652
00:26:36,092 --> 00:26:37,789
I don't do this,

653
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:39,878
Gavin Andrews goes to the bar
tomorrow with a list

654
00:26:39,922 --> 00:26:41,880
of shady things Samantha's
done over the years.

655
00:26:41,924 --> 00:26:43,491
So you can help me
with this or not.

656
00:26:43,534 --> 00:26:46,755
Either way, her name's
not going on that wall.

657
00:26:55,764 --> 00:26:57,785
Katrina, if you're here
to go out for drinks tonight,

658
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:00,943
I can only say that the answer
is a big, fat, "Yes, please."

659
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,772
As much as I would love
to say that's why I'm here,

660
00:27:03,815 --> 00:27:06,731
what I need is a big,
fat piece of advice.

661
00:27:06,775 --> 00:27:08,994
- What is it?
- Harvey...

662
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:12,389
basically asked me to
impersonate Samantha Wheeler.

663
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:14,347
What?

664
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:17,786
It's the only way to get what
they need to help Alex win.

665
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:20,832
- What'd you tell him?
- I told him I didn't know.

666
00:27:20,876 --> 00:27:24,923
Well, if Harvey wants you to
do this, why not do it?

667
00:27:24,967 --> 00:27:28,405
Other than not wanting to get
on Samantha's bad side,

668
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:31,495
Louis specifically told me not
to help either one of them.

669
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:33,062
Did he say why?

670
00:27:33,105 --> 00:27:34,822
He said that if too many
people got involved,

671
00:27:34,846 --> 00:27:38,763
their fight could tear
the firm apart.

672
00:27:38,807 --> 00:27:43,376
Then I say...too many people
are already involved.

673
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,944
You might as well go ahead.
Help Harvey.

674
00:27:45,988 --> 00:27:48,469
Thanks, Donna.

675
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,522
- What's this?
- A settlement agreement.

676
00:28:03,566 --> 00:28:05,960
You're dropping that lawsuit,
paying Gavin's legal fees,

677
00:28:06,003 --> 00:28:07,067
and issuing a public apology.

678
00:28:07,091 --> 00:28:08,571
The hell we are.

679
00:28:08,614 --> 00:28:10,418
Samantha, you can kick
and scream all you want,

680
00:28:10,442 --> 00:28:12,507
but I got proof the packing
company skimped on materials

681
00:28:12,531 --> 00:28:14,446
and your client knew about it.

682
00:28:17,449 --> 00:28:19,364
How the ----
did you get these?

683
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:20,646
The same way I got
everything else.

684
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,411
You shared it with
me in discovery.

685
00:28:22,454 --> 00:28:23,562
I didn't share shit with you.

686
00:28:23,586 --> 00:28:25,414
I never even saw
these documents.

687
00:28:25,457 --> 00:28:27,131
You never saw them because
you never wanted to see them.

688
00:28:27,155 --> 00:28:29,548
But Dexhart Insurance has
records proving it was sent.

689
00:28:29,592 --> 00:28:32,551
You son of a bitch.
You cheated.

690
00:28:32,595 --> 00:28:34,423
No, I just played
by your rules.

691
00:28:34,466 --> 00:28:36,096
- So don't start crying now.
- Oh, I'm not crying.

692
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,750
And I as sure as hell
am not signing this.

693
00:28:37,774 --> 00:28:39,534
And let me tell you what
happens if you don't.

694
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:41,430
Gavin Andrews
gets you disbarred.

695
00:28:41,473 --> 00:28:43,040
- What?
- He's got information

696
00:28:43,084 --> 00:28:44,757
that could end your career
and he told me to use it,

697
00:28:44,781 --> 00:28:46,957
but I didn't because I didn't
wanna do that to you.

698
00:28:47,001 --> 00:28:49,612
So, what?
I'm supposed to thank you now?

699
00:28:49,655 --> 00:28:51,179
I don't expect
you to thank me,

700
00:28:51,222 --> 00:28:53,007
but I do expect you
to accept that it's over.

701
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:55,400
- I'm not accepting anything.
- I get it.

702
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:56,662
You're not used to losing.

703
00:28:56,706 --> 00:28:58,534
But whether you wanna
admit it or not,

704
00:28:58,577 --> 00:29:00,579
I won, you lost.

705
00:29:00,623 --> 00:29:03,756
And come tomorrow, my name's
going up on that wall.

706
00:29:16,639 --> 00:29:18,467
Louis, what are
you doing here?

707
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,990
Not bringing
you more flowers,

708
00:29:20,034 --> 00:29:21,600
if that's what
you're wondering.

709
00:29:21,644 --> 00:29:23,994
Sheila, the reason I was so
thrown with you taking on

710
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:26,997
more responsibility
was because...

711
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:30,609
I was afraid that I wouldn't
be able to take on less.

712
00:29:30,653 --> 00:29:32,849
And whether you are offered
the permanent position or not,

713
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:34,483
when the time comes,

714
00:29:34,526 --> 00:29:36,615
I wanna take time
for our family.

715
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:39,488
Well, I'm--I'm glad
to hear you say that.

716
00:29:42,883 --> 00:29:44,797
Because the time has come.

717
00:29:44,841 --> 00:29:47,104
You mean you were offered
the permanent position?

718
00:29:47,148 --> 00:29:48,758
No, not that time, Louis.

719
00:29:50,586 --> 00:29:51,848
The other time.

720
00:29:53,067 --> 00:29:54,807
Oh, my God.

721
00:29:54,851 --> 00:29:56,548
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

722
00:29:56,592 --> 00:29:59,029
I saw Chaz this afternoon.

723
00:29:59,073 --> 00:30:03,120
And we're not gonna need
that surgery because...

724
00:30:03,164 --> 00:30:05,688
we're gonna have a baby.

725
00:30:05,731 --> 00:30:08,256
I don't believe this.
Are you sure?

726
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:12,608
I mean...
are you absolutely sure?

727
00:30:12,651 --> 00:30:14,218
Yes, I'm positive.

728
00:30:14,262 --> 00:30:17,178
And I'm sorry we fought.

729
00:30:17,221 --> 00:30:19,832
I just--I'm stressed,

730
00:30:19,876 --> 00:30:22,661
and I've got hormones
running through me

731
00:30:22,705 --> 00:30:24,726
and I'm not even sure if I
want that permanent position.

732
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:28,058
Hey, it's okay.

733
00:30:28,102 --> 00:30:29,842
It's all gonna be okay.

734
00:30:29,886 --> 00:30:33,194
I am right here by your side.
I'm not going anywhere.

735
00:30:33,237 --> 00:30:34,847
How are you so calm?

736
00:30:34,891 --> 00:30:37,763
Because I know what's important now.

737
00:30:37,807 --> 00:30:41,680
And it's this.

738
00:30:41,724 --> 00:30:43,073
Everything's gonna be okay.

739
00:30:43,117 --> 00:30:44,857
Okay.

740
00:30:54,128 --> 00:30:56,913
I got your message.
You're late.

741
00:30:56,957 --> 00:31:00,090
- I had some thinking to do.
- Well, I'm glad you showed up.

742
00:31:00,134 --> 00:31:02,112
Because I was beginning to
wonder if I was meeting you

743
00:31:02,136 --> 00:31:03,702
or the feds in here tonight.

744
00:31:03,746 --> 00:31:05,574
I think I have a way
to get you out of this.

745
00:31:05,617 --> 00:31:07,576
You mind if I ask you
what changed your mind?

746
00:31:07,619 --> 00:31:10,100
Because I believe you.

747
00:31:10,144 --> 00:31:11,841
I also know if
I do this for you,

748
00:31:11,884 --> 00:31:14,191
you'll always have my back.
- You're saying I owe you?

749
00:31:14,235 --> 00:31:16,802
I'm saying you'll
feel grateful.

750
00:31:16,846 --> 00:31:20,241
- It isn't the same thing.
- No, it's not.

751
00:31:20,284 --> 00:31:21,894
So, what's your plan?

752
00:31:21,938 --> 00:31:23,738
Who here do you trust
more than anyone else?

753
00:31:23,766 --> 00:31:25,724
After tonight, that's easy.

754
00:31:25,768 --> 00:31:27,248
- You.
- No, it can't be me.

755
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:28,858
It raises too many red flags.

756
00:31:28,901 --> 00:31:31,121
Besides, I'm not old enough.
It's not my time.

757
00:31:31,165 --> 00:31:32,775
Well, what are you
talking about?

758
00:31:32,818 --> 00:31:34,342
Just answer the question.

759
00:31:34,385 --> 00:31:36,170
You need somebody here
to have your back.

760
00:31:36,213 --> 00:31:38,128
It isn't me.
Who is it?

761
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:41,697
Two people.

762
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,744
- Ellen Rand and Eric Kaldor.
- Then get them.

763
00:31:45,788 --> 00:31:47,920
'Cause we're not out
of the woods yet.

764
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,777
It's good that you reached
out to me when you did.

765
00:31:58,801 --> 00:32:00,933
I was starting to think
you made a wrong choice.

766
00:32:00,977 --> 00:32:02,935
I've made enough wrong
choices in my life, Tom.

767
00:32:02,979 --> 00:32:05,155
I'm not gonna make
a wrong one on this.

768
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:07,157
- So, what'd you find?
- Nothing.

769
00:32:07,201 --> 00:32:09,203
All I found was a glitch
in the billing system.

770
00:32:09,246 --> 00:32:10,745
Bullshit, we've got
information that your firm--

771
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:11,964
I don't care what you've got.

772
00:32:11,988 --> 00:32:13,903
Clients were overcharged
then reimbursed.

773
00:32:13,946 --> 00:32:15,296
That's all there was to it.

774
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:17,167
And when I subpoena
every billing record

775
00:32:17,211 --> 00:32:19,343
from the last five years,
that's never gonna hold up.

776
00:32:19,387 --> 00:32:20,929
And if you could have
subpoenaed those records,

777
00:32:20,953 --> 00:32:22,801
you wouldn't have come to me
in the first place.

778
00:32:22,825 --> 00:32:24,174
I get it.

779
00:32:24,218 --> 00:32:25,784
They paid you off,

780
00:32:25,828 --> 00:32:27,656
and now you're as guilty
as they are, huh?

781
00:32:27,699 --> 00:32:29,266
Don't you say that to me.

782
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,747
You tried to used my history
to get me to turn on my family.

783
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,966
And if you unseal my records,
I guarantee you the firm

784
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:36,839
of Rand Kaldor Zane will use
every resource they have

785
00:32:36,882 --> 00:32:39,885
to come after you
for malicious prosecution.

786
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:41,974
- Rand Kaldor Zane?
- That's right.

787
00:32:42,018 --> 00:32:43,889
Jarvis, Ellis, and Green
are all stepping down,

788
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:46,022
so if you're convinced
they really did something,

789
00:32:46,066 --> 00:32:48,198
think of it as a little
punishment getting served

790
00:32:48,242 --> 00:32:49,808
after all.
- That's not punishment.

791
00:32:49,852 --> 00:32:51,375
That's getting away Scot-free.

792
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:53,440
And if you think having your
name ripped off the wall

793
00:32:53,464 --> 00:32:55,268
when you've worked your entire
life to get up there

794
00:32:55,292 --> 00:32:57,227
isn't punishment, you don't
know what it is to be a lawyer.

795
00:32:57,251 --> 00:32:59,688
Because trust me,
it's all any of us ever want.

796
00:32:59,731 --> 00:33:01,361
Then why didn't you put
your own name up there?

797
00:33:01,385 --> 00:33:03,300
Because it's not my time,
Tom.

798
00:33:03,344 --> 00:33:05,346
But you can bet your ass
someday it will be.

799
00:33:13,745 --> 00:33:15,225
Samantha.

800
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:18,881
Are you here
to tell me you won?

801
00:33:18,924 --> 00:33:21,666
I'm here to tell you Alex
Williams has a smoking gun.

802
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,669
- And he's got me dead to rights.
- What?

803
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:28,020
I lost, Robert.

804
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,457
It's over.

805
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,373
How the hell did that happen?

806
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,244
I had him.

807
00:33:34,288 --> 00:33:37,856
I had my foot on Gavin's neck.

808
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,033
I gave him extra time.

809
00:33:41,077 --> 00:33:44,254
And I'm not gonna lose what's
mine because Alex

810
00:33:44,298 --> 00:33:47,039
used that time to win.
- What are you saying?

811
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:48,954
I don't give a shit
what the agreement was.

812
00:33:48,998 --> 00:33:50,260
My name's going up on that
wall,

813
00:33:50,304 --> 00:33:51,455
and you're gonna
make it happen.

814
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:52,958
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

815
00:33:53,002 --> 00:33:54,873
- Samantha--
- God damn it, Robert!

816
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:56,962
They found those files,
which means you didn't tip

817
00:33:57,006 --> 00:33:58,747
the scales at all.

818
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:01,010
What is it gonna take for you
to get off the sidelines?

819
00:34:01,053 --> 00:34:03,360
I wouldn't have to get off
the sidelines if you hadn't

820
00:34:03,404 --> 00:34:05,319
shown Gavin Andrews mercy!

821
00:34:05,362 --> 00:34:06,992
Well, I didn't just do that
because he's still a client.

822
00:34:07,016 --> 00:34:09,453
I did it because he
told me he had a family.

823
00:34:09,497 --> 00:34:12,413
Just like you once did.

824
00:34:12,456 --> 00:34:13,936
You're saying I owe you.

825
00:34:13,979 --> 00:34:16,417
You have owed me for years,
and you know it.

826
00:34:18,158 --> 00:34:19,942
And before you gave them
your word,

827
00:34:19,985 --> 00:34:22,814
you gave your word to me.

828
00:34:22,858 --> 00:34:24,860
So the question is,

829
00:34:24,903 --> 00:34:27,123
which word are you
gonna live up to?

830
00:34:47,142 --> 00:34:48,926
Louis, we need to talk.
It's important.

831
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:52,539
Yeah, of course.
Come in.

832
00:34:52,582 --> 00:34:55,019
Actually, I'm glad you're here,

833
00:34:55,063 --> 00:34:56,519
'cause I have some big
news of my own.

834
00:34:56,543 --> 00:34:59,110
Well, whatever it is,
it's not as big as this.

835
00:34:59,154 --> 00:35:00,958
Robert's about to tell Harvey
that he's gonna put up

836
00:35:00,982 --> 00:35:02,505
Samantha's name
instead of Alex's.

837
00:35:02,549 --> 00:35:04,028
No, no, Alex won.

838
00:35:04,072 --> 00:35:05,528
Robert can't break
his word like that.

839
00:35:05,552 --> 00:35:06,920
Well, he's going to,
and if we don't do something,

840
00:35:06,944 --> 00:35:08,095
we're not gonna have
a firm tomorrow.

841
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:10,513
We're gonna have
a war on our hands.

842
00:35:10,557 --> 00:35:12,211
Okay, I hear you.

843
00:35:12,254 --> 00:35:13,927
First thing tomorrow we'll get
into a conference room

844
00:35:13,951 --> 00:35:15,059
and we'll talk
this thing through.

845
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:16,103
Louis, it's too late
for that.

846
00:35:16,127 --> 00:35:19,043
The time for talking is over.

847
00:35:19,087 --> 00:35:21,959
We need to do something.

848
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:25,049
- And that something is--
- I'll step down.

849
00:35:25,093 --> 00:35:27,487
What?

850
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,272
Donna, Sheila's pregnant.

851
00:35:30,316 --> 00:35:32,056
I'm gonna be a father.

852
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,599
- Oh, my God.
- I was gonna ratchet down

853
00:35:33,623 --> 00:35:35,190
anyway.

854
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:37,497
This way they can both
put their names up.

855
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:41,283
Louis, I am so happy for you.

856
00:35:41,327 --> 00:35:43,174
- But that's not gonna work.
- What are you saying?

857
00:35:43,198 --> 00:35:46,157
I'm saying you need to step
in as managing partner.

858
00:35:47,942 --> 00:35:49,117
- What?
- Louis,

859
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,206
Robert can't run
this firm right now

860
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,687
and neither can Harvey.
You're the only one who can.

861
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,210
Sorry, Donna.
I can't.

862
00:35:55,254 --> 00:35:57,256
- Why not?
- Because I'm not a leader.

863
00:35:57,299 --> 00:35:58,953
They won't follow me.

864
00:35:58,996 --> 00:36:01,608
Louis.

865
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:04,045
I know you went to Katrina
to protect the firm.

866
00:36:04,088 --> 00:36:07,048
And you just offered to step
down to do the same thing.

867
00:36:07,091 --> 00:36:09,093
If that's not the leadership
we need right now,

868
00:36:09,137 --> 00:36:11,182
I don't know what is.
- Why does it have to be now?

869
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,490
I just wanna be a father.

870
00:36:14,534 --> 00:36:16,579
And the last thing I'd
ever wanna do is take that

871
00:36:16,623 --> 00:36:18,102
away from you.

872
00:36:18,146 --> 00:36:20,714
But your baby's not due
for another nine months.

873
00:36:20,757 --> 00:36:22,498
And this firm
is your baby too,

874
00:36:22,542 --> 00:36:25,588
and it needs you right now.

875
00:36:25,632 --> 00:36:27,262
I can't make that
decision without talking

876
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:30,637
to Sheila first.
- Then hurry.

877
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,639
Because we don't have
a lot of time.

878
00:36:32,682 --> 00:36:38,688
Donna, even if I said yes...

879
00:36:38,732 --> 00:36:40,342
Harvey and Robert
would never vote

880
00:36:40,386 --> 00:36:42,736
to make me managing partner.

881
00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:45,608
You leave that to me.

882
00:37:00,188 --> 00:37:03,147
I take it you're celebrating.

883
00:37:03,191 --> 00:37:05,149
It's a drink, Robert.

884
00:37:05,193 --> 00:37:06,673
I'm not rubbing it
in anybody's face,

885
00:37:06,716 --> 00:37:11,242
but yeah,
I'm happy for my guy.

886
00:37:11,286 --> 00:37:14,333
Well, I'm here
to say something

887
00:37:14,376 --> 00:37:16,335
that's gonna make
you less happy.

888
00:37:16,378 --> 00:37:18,685
What's that?

889
00:37:18,728 --> 00:37:22,776
I'm putting Samantha's name
on the wall, not Alex's.

890
00:37:22,819 --> 00:37:25,344
I must be getting
old because...

891
00:37:25,387 --> 00:37:27,346
I'm pretty sure
I just heard you say

892
00:37:27,389 --> 00:37:28,695
you're breaking your word.

893
00:37:28,738 --> 00:37:30,131
Harvey, I know.
I made a promise.

894
00:37:30,174 --> 00:37:31,369
You didn't just
make a promise.

895
00:37:31,393 --> 00:37:33,047
You looked me in the
eye and you said,

896
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,353
"Let's settle this
in the ring."

897
00:37:34,396 --> 00:37:36,050
And I don't care.
I owe her.

898
00:37:36,093 --> 00:37:38,052
Then you should have put
her name up years ago.

899
00:37:38,095 --> 00:37:40,073
- Not when it costs someone else.
- God damn it, I am

900
00:37:40,097 --> 00:37:41,577
the managing partner
of this firm.

901
00:37:41,621 --> 00:37:43,642
And we can change that right
now because I was here

902
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:47,235
before you and I'm gonna be
here long after you're gone.

903
00:37:47,278 --> 00:37:49,324
- Are you threatening me?
- I'm giving you a choice.

904
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:51,805
You and Samantha can accept
Alex or you can pack up

905
00:37:51,848 --> 00:37:53,633
your shit right now.
- I'm not going anywhere

906
00:37:53,676 --> 00:37:55,393
and neither is Samantha,
because you're the past,

907
00:37:55,417 --> 00:37:56,592
and she's the future.

908
00:37:56,636 --> 00:37:57,724
Not here, she's not.

909
00:37:57,767 --> 00:37:59,334
Now get the ----
out of my office.

910
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:00,814
That's enough.

911
00:38:00,857 --> 00:38:02,697
No one's going anywhere,
and neither one of you

912
00:38:02,729 --> 00:38:05,079
is managing partner anymore.
- Donna, stay out of this.

913
00:38:05,122 --> 00:38:06,404
No, I am putting
a stop to this,

914
00:38:06,428 --> 00:38:08,778
and I'm putting
a stop to it right now.

915
00:38:08,822 --> 00:38:10,606
'Cause this isn't just
a friendly gathering.

916
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:12,652
This is a formal
partner meeting.

917
00:38:12,695 --> 00:38:14,741
And here's how it's gonna go.

918
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,699
I'm voting for Louis
for managing partner.

919
00:38:16,743 --> 00:38:18,614
And he's voting for himself.

920
00:38:18,658 --> 00:38:20,331
And since there is no way that
either one of you is voting

921
00:38:20,355 --> 00:38:22,401
for the other,
you might as well both vote

922
00:38:22,444 --> 00:38:24,620
for him and keep this
a united front.

923
00:38:24,664 --> 00:38:27,406
Because make no mistake.
Louis is managing partner.

924
00:38:27,449 --> 00:38:28,755
Bullshit.

925
00:38:28,798 --> 00:38:30,365
There's no way you're
pulling this off.

926
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:31,690
She's not pulling this off,
Robert.

927
00:38:31,714 --> 00:38:33,281
I am.

928
00:38:33,324 --> 00:38:35,152
This is happening whether
you like it or not.

929
00:38:35,196 --> 00:38:36,478
So you think you have what
it takes to run this firm?

930
00:38:36,502 --> 00:38:38,417
I know I do.

931
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,220
And my first order of business
is promoting Alex and Samantha

932
00:38:40,244 --> 00:38:41,637
at the same time.

933
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:43,441
And any managing partner
worth his salt can see

934
00:38:43,465 --> 00:38:45,249
they'll never go for it.
- No.

935
00:38:45,293 --> 00:38:47,097
They're either both gonna
accept this or they're both

936
00:38:47,121 --> 00:38:48,664
gonna walk the ---- out
the door because I am sick

937
00:38:48,688 --> 00:38:50,124
of this shit.

938
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:51,473
And I'll tell you
something else.

939
00:38:51,517 --> 00:38:54,433
You two are gonna goddamn
sell it to them.

940
00:38:56,696 --> 00:38:58,175
So, what's it gonna be?

941
00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:00,482
Me and Louis and
a split decision?

942
00:39:00,526 --> 00:39:03,137
Or are we gonna make
this thing unanimous?

943
00:39:13,887 --> 00:39:15,671
How'd they take it?

944
00:39:15,715 --> 00:39:17,281
Kicking and screaming.

945
00:39:17,325 --> 00:39:19,327
Bet you wouldn't
have it any other way.

946
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:22,286
Nope, I wouldn't.

947
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:25,289
What'd you tell
Rand and Kaldor?

948
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:28,684
That all they had to do was
be ready to act in charge,

949
00:39:28,728 --> 00:39:31,165
and I could get them the firm.

950
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:32,514
And let me guess.

951
00:39:32,558 --> 00:39:35,909
They knew not to ask any
more questions than that.

952
00:39:35,952 --> 00:39:38,825
Isn't that what being
a great lawyer is all about?

953
00:39:38,868 --> 00:39:40,740
Sometimes.

954
00:39:40,783 --> 00:39:44,265
Sometimes it's about asking
the right questions.

955
00:39:44,308 --> 00:39:46,746
Okay, then.

956
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:48,878
- Why'd you do it?
- Do what?

957
00:39:48,922 --> 00:39:50,706
Help me.

958
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,317
And don't give me that line
about always having your back,

959
00:39:53,361 --> 00:39:56,799
because it's gotta be
about something more.

960
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,933
I didn't have a father.

961
00:39:59,976 --> 00:40:01,325
What?

962
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:03,458
I have no idea
who my parents were.

963
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:06,287
Didn't even know their names.

964
00:40:06,896 --> 00:40:10,334
I bounced around
the foster care system.

965
00:40:10,378 --> 00:40:13,512
Never lived in the same place
for more than two years.

966
00:40:13,555 --> 00:40:15,165
What does that
have to do with--

967
00:40:15,209 --> 00:40:17,516
Your daughter.

968
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:21,215
I helped you because I would
have given anything to have

969
00:40:21,258 --> 00:40:23,347
someone like you
looking out for me.

970
00:40:25,393 --> 00:40:27,351
And I didn't wanna
take it away from her.

971
00:40:33,009 --> 00:40:35,272
I don't know what to say.

972
00:40:35,316 --> 00:40:36,902
Say that from now on I'll
always have someone

973
00:40:36,926 --> 00:40:38,928
looking out for me.

974
00:40:49,809 --> 00:40:51,550
- Robert.
- Samantha, have a seat.

975
00:40:51,593 --> 00:40:52,986
I don't want one.

976
00:40:53,029 --> 00:40:54,572
Unless you're saying
it's a seat at the table.

977
00:40:54,596 --> 00:40:57,381
It is.

978
00:40:57,425 --> 00:40:58,861
But you're not alone.

979
00:40:58,905 --> 00:41:00,341
Alex is getting
a promotion too.

980
00:41:00,384 --> 00:41:01,951
Are you kidding me?

981
00:41:01,995 --> 00:41:03,997
The whole point
of there being only one

982
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,607
is to have it mean something.

983
00:41:05,651 --> 00:41:07,566
I know what the point is,
Samantha.

984
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:11,221
- So you sold me out.
- I didn't sell anyone out!

985
00:41:11,265 --> 00:41:13,920
I once told you
I'd look out for you.

986
00:41:13,963 --> 00:41:16,400
And I let that get in my head
and it almost cost us

987
00:41:16,444 --> 00:41:18,402
what we have here.

988
00:41:18,446 --> 00:41:20,927
So now I'm gonna look out for
you in a way that I should have

989
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:22,885
in the first place.
- How's that?

990
00:41:22,929 --> 00:41:24,539
By telling you the truth.

991
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:27,586
They beat us at our own game,
Samantha.

992
00:41:27,629 --> 00:41:30,980
Whether we like it or not.

993
00:41:31,024 --> 00:41:34,636
But you know what that means?

994
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,945
We are surrounded by
some badass people.

995
00:41:38,988 --> 00:41:41,251
So let's stop fighting in here
and start fighting

996
00:41:41,295 --> 00:41:43,602
everyone else out there.

997
00:41:45,342 --> 00:41:48,563
Because it's time
to make peace.

998
00:41:51,566 --> 00:41:53,350
Am I interrupting?

999
00:41:55,483 --> 00:41:57,659
Because I wanted to say
Harvey gave me the news,

1000
00:41:57,703 --> 00:42:01,620
and I'm good with
it if you are.

1001
00:42:04,492 --> 00:42:07,843
Of course I am, partner.

1002
00:42:07,887 --> 00:42:11,064
Then I guess there's only
one thing to figure out.

1003
00:42:11,107 --> 00:42:15,546
Williams-Wheeler
or Wheeler-Williams.

1004
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:18,854
You won, Alex.
It's your choice.

1005
00:42:21,074 --> 00:42:23,642
So what do you say we have
ourselves

1006
00:42:23,685 --> 00:42:25,644
a good old-fashioned
group hug?

1007
00:42:27,907 --> 00:42:34,087
♪ I can feel it coming
in the air tonight ♪

1008
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:37,656
♪ Oh, Lord ♪

1009
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:44,358
♪ And I've been waiting for
this moment for all my life ♪

1010
00:42:44,401 --> 00:42:47,361
♪ Oh, Lord ♪

1011
00:42:47,404 --> 00:42:49,624
Harvey, it's been a long day,

1012
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:51,060
so if you're here
to yell at me--

1013
00:42:51,104 --> 00:42:54,716
Relax, Louis.
I'm here to say thank you.

1014
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:59,503
We lost ourselves
and you brought us back.

1015
00:42:59,547 --> 00:43:02,376
Thanks, Harvey.
Appreciate that.

1016
00:43:02,419 --> 00:43:03,919
It takes a lot
of balls to come at me

1017
00:43:03,943 --> 00:43:06,510
and Robert like that.
- No, Harvey, it didn't.

1018
00:43:06,554 --> 00:43:09,949
Because for the first time,
I didn't care how either one

1019
00:43:09,992 --> 00:43:11,515
of you saw me because...

1020
00:43:13,561 --> 00:43:15,104
I didn't even care to
be managing partner

1021
00:43:15,128 --> 00:43:19,088
in the first place.
- What do you mean?

1022
00:43:19,132 --> 00:43:21,090
I'm gonna have
a baby, Harvey.

1023
00:43:23,005 --> 00:43:25,529
I'm gonna be a dad.

1024
00:43:25,573 --> 00:43:31,361
And once that hit me, dealing
with this felt so simple.

1025
00:43:31,405 --> 00:43:34,713
Congratulations, Louis.

1026
00:43:34,756 --> 00:43:37,716
I think you're gonna make
a great managing partner,

1027
00:43:37,759 --> 00:43:41,067
and I know you're gonna make
an outstanding father.

1028
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:47,421
You two need to get a room?
Or does anybody wanna go out

1029
00:43:47,464 --> 00:43:49,031
and celebrate?

1030
00:43:49,075 --> 00:43:51,599
Actually I think I'm just
gonna stay here for a bit

1031
00:43:51,642 --> 00:43:54,123
and take it all in.

1032
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:56,169
I understand.

1033
00:43:56,212 --> 00:43:59,085
- Good night, Louis.
- Good night.

1034
00:44:03,132 --> 00:44:04,568
Level with me.

1035
00:44:04,612 --> 00:44:06,092
You really think
he can handle this?

1036
00:44:06,135 --> 00:44:09,051
I think desperate times
require desperate measures.

1037
00:44:09,095 --> 00:44:10,444
And I think
something else too.

1038
00:44:10,487 --> 00:44:12,054
What's that?

1039
00:44:12,098 --> 00:44:13,708
I'm going to enjoy watching

1040
00:44:13,752 --> 00:44:15,579
you and Robert take orders
from Louis.

1041
00:44:15,623 --> 00:44:18,104
We're not gonna be the only
ones he's in charge of.

1042
00:44:18,147 --> 00:44:19,734
He'll be giving you
plenty of orders, too.

1043
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:22,108
No, he won't.
You're forgetting.

1044
00:44:22,151 --> 00:44:23,718
I'm the Louis Whisperer.

1045
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:25,589
Are you sure about that?

1046
00:44:25,633 --> 00:44:27,480
When he walked in, he said you
weren't pulling it off.

1047
00:44:27,504 --> 00:44:28,568
- He was.
- And who do you think

1048
00:44:28,592 --> 00:44:29,768
told him to say that?

1049
00:44:29,811 --> 00:44:31,508
Holy shit,
are you saying you're

1050
00:44:31,552 --> 00:44:33,597
the real managing partner?
- I'm not saying that.

1051
00:44:33,641 --> 00:44:36,078
But I'm also not
not saying that.

1052
00:44:36,122 --> 00:44:39,778
Come on, pretty.
