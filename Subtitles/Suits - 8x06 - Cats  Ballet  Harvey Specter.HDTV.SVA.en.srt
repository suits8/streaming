1
00:00:00,124 --> 00:00:01,275
<i>Previously, on "Suits..."</i>

2
00:00:01,327 --> 00:00:03,362
I want to talk to you
about doing more pro bonos.

3
00:00:03,363 --> 00:00:05,135
If you want to take on a pro
Bono, knock yourself out.

4
00:00:05,136 --> 00:00:08,380
What is a COO of a law firm
doing handing out pro bonos

5
00:00:08,381 --> 00:00:09,045
in the first place?

6
00:00:09,046 --> 00:00:10,992
- I just thought that it...
- Rhetorical question, Donna.

7
00:00:10,993 --> 00:00:12,359
I don't care what you thought.

8
00:00:12,395 --> 00:00:13,858
I need you to supervise
Brian Altman.

9
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:16,122
- Have someone else manage him.
- Damn it, Katrina.

10
00:00:16,123 --> 00:00:17,822
This is your chance
to be senior partner.

11
00:00:17,858 --> 00:00:19,958
I was just thinking about
where we were a week ago

12
00:00:19,993 --> 00:00:21,671
when I thought you were
cold and heartless.

13
00:00:21,695 --> 00:00:23,535
And I went from that
to being your best friend.

14
00:00:23,564 --> 00:00:24,496
I wouldn't say best friend.

15
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:25,263
You want to know something
about me?

16
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:26,575
You go ahead and ask.

17
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:28,452
And how should I trust that
I'd get a straight answer?

18
00:00:28,453 --> 00:00:30,431
Because I am
on this team now.

19
00:00:30,432 --> 00:00:32,699
I've got its
best interests at heart.

20
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:34,568
<i>- I'm getting a divorce.</i>
- What?

21
00:00:34,603 --> 00:00:36,303
I was hoping
that you could represent me.

22
00:00:36,338 --> 00:00:38,238
It's my brother;
what am I supposed to do?

23
00:00:38,273 --> 00:00:39,784
I think that this could bring
up a lot of shit for you.

24
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:41,174
He still loves you.

25
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:43,109
He deserves another chance
as a father.

26
00:00:43,145 --> 00:00:45,123
<i>It was one of the hardest
things I've ever had to do.</i>

27
00:00:45,147 --> 00:00:46,980
I swear
it took a piece of me, Donna.

28
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:48,448
You could look at it

29
00:00:48,483 --> 00:00:50,483
like you chose to give
a piece of yourself.

30
00:00:55,357 --> 00:00:57,123
Alex.

31
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,124
Can I talk to you
about something?

32
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,226
Sure, Donna,
what's going on?

33
00:01:00,262 --> 00:01:02,829
Well, ever since I got
promoted

34
00:01:02,864 --> 00:01:05,298
I've been looking for
a way to give back.

35
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:06,711
And it turns out
that a friend of mine

36
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:09,636
is working for a charity
that helps at-risk girls.

37
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:12,462
And I figured the best way for
me to give some of my time...

38
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:14,408
Would be to convince some
lawyers to give some of theirs.

39
00:01:14,432 --> 00:01:15,531
Exactly.

40
00:01:15,566 --> 00:01:18,067
Donna, I'd love to say yes,
but I'm slammed right now.

41
00:01:18,102 --> 00:01:19,179
and a charity
like this deserves

42
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:20,602
more time than I can offer.

43
00:01:20,638 --> 00:01:23,639
I appreciate you
hearing me out.

44
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:25,441
I'll find somebody else.

45
00:01:25,476 --> 00:01:27,543
Donna, I have to ask.
Given how it went

46
00:01:27,578 --> 00:01:28,410
the last time you took on
a pro Bono,

47
00:01:28,446 --> 00:01:29,723
have you cleared this
with Robert?

48
00:01:29,747 --> 00:01:32,181
I'd hate to see him bite
your head off a second time.

49
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:35,017
Trust me, Alex, I don't make
the same mistake twice.

50
00:01:35,052 --> 00:01:36,952
Robert's good with it.

51
00:01:36,987 --> 00:01:39,154
Then I hope you find someone
to handle it for you.

52
00:01:47,485 --> 00:01:49,318
Louis, what can I do for you?

53
00:01:49,354 --> 00:01:51,432
Not me. I'm here about what
you can do for Emmet Ford.

54
00:01:51,456 --> 00:01:52,186
You mean the owner

55
00:01:52,187 --> 00:01:53,941
of the hottest online retailer
in the world.

56
00:01:53,942 --> 00:01:55,319
Yes I do. He wants to
go public; there's a problem;

57
00:01:55,343 --> 00:01:57,210
and you need to drop
everything you're doing.

58
00:01:57,245 --> 00:01:58,456
Louis, I can't right now.
I'm up to

59
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,213
my eyeballs in the
Ratchinson brief.

60
00:02:00,248 --> 00:02:02,026
Then give it to someone else.
This is too important.

61
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,282
Well,
if it's so important,

62
00:02:03,318 --> 00:02:04,462
why don't you
handle it yourself?

63
00:02:04,486 --> 00:02:07,020
I can't.

64
00:02:07,055 --> 00:02:08,888
Louis, what's going on?

65
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:16,481
Katrina, you need this
to make senior partner.

66
00:02:16,517 --> 00:02:18,350
What? I thought
I had to show Robert

67
00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:19,317
I could manage people

68
00:02:19,353 --> 00:02:21,186
to make senior partner,
which I did.

69
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:23,321
It's not Robert.
Every partner gets a vote.

70
00:02:23,357 --> 00:02:26,124
And Paul goddamn Porter wants...
Don't tell me.

71
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,627
That douchebag Hanrahan.
Yes.

72
00:02:28,662 --> 00:02:30,595
Katrina, look,
I know I let you down,

73
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:32,397
and I'm sorry.

74
00:02:33,096 --> 00:02:34,407
But you bring this home,
I promise

75
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:37,032
you will be senior partner
next quarter.

76
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:38,934
Okay, Louis.

77
00:02:39,837 --> 00:02:42,337
I'll take care of it.
Good.

78
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:44,083
Now I have to go deliver
some more shitty news

79
00:02:44,107 --> 00:02:46,227
to someone who's gonna be
less understanding than you.

80
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:53,345
I get it. You're going
through with the divorce,

81
00:02:53,369 --> 00:02:55,102
but I don't see why you can't...

82
00:02:56,272 --> 00:02:58,172
No, I'm not okay with it,
Marcus,

83
00:02:58,207 --> 00:02:59,840
but I guess I have to be.

84
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,943
Look, I got to go.
Bye.

85
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:05,281
Louis, whatever it is,
does it have to be now?

86
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:06,615
I wish it didn't, Harvey,

87
00:03:06,651 --> 00:03:09,184
but I got a call from
Dominic Barone a week ago.

88
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,954
Aston Martin put in offer
to acquire McKernon Motors.

89
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:13,175
And I assume
you're here to ask

90
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:15,025
where they should shove
that offer because...

91
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:17,293
I'm here to tell you
Dominic's taking it.

92
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:18,472
Louis,
if McKernon is acquired...

93
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:20,346
Dominic won't be
our client anymore. I know.

94
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:22,914
Undo it. Nevermind.
I'll call him myself.

95
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,816
Harvey, it is what he wants.

96
00:03:24,852 --> 00:03:25,929
Bullshit, he doesn't know
what he wants.

97
00:03:25,953 --> 00:03:27,052
Yes, he does.

98
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:28,299
And he's my client now.

99
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,577
It's a done deal,
and I need you to accept

100
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:31,901
what he wants,
even if it means losing him.

101
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:33,660
Louis.
I've been looking for you.

102
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:34,693
Joan Walsh is here.

103
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:36,488
Wait, what?
She's not on my schedule.

104
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:37,867
I know.
She says it's an emergency.

105
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:39,902
Well, I'm sorry I don't have
time for her right now, Donna.

106
00:03:39,903 --> 00:03:42,036
- Why the hell not?
- Because...

107
00:03:42,072 --> 00:03:43,549
I have an appointment
on my other schedule.

108
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:44,819
What's that supposed to mean?

109
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,431
It means I need to see Sheila
right now, okay?

110
00:03:46,455 --> 00:03:47,521
And you know why.

111
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:49,913
Let me get this straight.
You're leaving the office

112
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:50,981
when a client has an emergency

113
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:52,836
so you can fool around
with your girlfriend.

114
00:03:52,837 --> 00:03:54,020
- Harvey.
- Yes, I am.

115
00:03:54,021 --> 00:03:55,594
And I know this isn't
the best time to ask,

116
00:03:55,595 --> 00:03:56,892
but she is an old client
of yours.

117
00:03:56,893 --> 00:03:58,781
So if you can
please take the meeting,

118
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:00,665
I will handle whatever it is
when I get back.

119
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,453
Sure, Louis,
you go ahead and enjoy

120
00:04:02,488 --> 00:04:03,679
your afternoon delight.

121
00:04:03,714 --> 00:04:06,148
I'll just be here letting
Dominic sell his company

122
00:04:06,184 --> 00:04:07,944
and babysitting Joan Walsh
while you're gone.

123
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:17,256
Harvey. What are you
doing here? I was...

124
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,156
Expecting Louis?

125
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,751
Well,
he's not available right now,

126
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:21,436
but I hear you have
an emergency, Joan.

127
00:04:21,437 --> 00:04:22,803
So why don't you read me in.

128
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:26,941
A model named Daisy Jones
posted a video claiming

129
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:28,849
my concealer gave her
an allergic reaction.

130
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,917
Sales on my new line
are tanking.

131
00:04:30,952 --> 00:04:32,051
All right,
I'll take care of it.

132
00:04:32,052 --> 00:04:33,999
Where is she based?
New York or Miami?

133
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,208
- Cleveland.
- I'm sorry?

134
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,009
She's not your typical model,
Harvey.

135
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,844
She's a digital influencer.

136
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,579
All right, well,
who is she managed by?

137
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,548
Her mother, last I checked.

138
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,817
Joan, how old is this person?

139
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:46,617
16.

140
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:47,730
Then,
with all due respect,

141
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,354
send her a gift basket
and be done with it.

142
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,657
Harvey, you don't get it.

143
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,792
This girl has
50 million followers.

144
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,761
We need to sue her
into the ground before

145
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,238
she tanks my whole company.

146
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,257
We also need to be
conscious of your image,

147
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,126
and suing a 16-year-old
isn't a pretty picture.

148
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:04,939
It's not the picture
I'm worried about, Harvey.

149
00:05:04,963 --> 00:05:06,863
It's that video.

150
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:09,432
So are you going to find
a way to get it down,

151
00:05:09,468 --> 00:05:11,632
or do I need to find
another firm who can?

Samantha.

165
00:05:49,406 --> 00:05:50,450
What can I do for you today?

166
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:51,239
Actually,
I thought there might be

167
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:52,445
something I can do for you.

168
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:53,967
I heard you're looking
for representation

169
00:05:53,968 --> 00:05:55,701
for your charity.

170
00:05:55,737 --> 00:05:57,804
Oh, that's nice
of you to offer,

171
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,473
but I know how much
Robert leans on you,

172
00:06:00,508 --> 00:06:01,552
and I don't think
he's gonna be okay

173
00:06:01,576 --> 00:06:04,343
with me doing it
if it means you doing it.

174
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:06,190
Why do I get the feeling
that even if you would be

175
00:06:06,214 --> 00:06:07,780
okay with me doing this
you aren't?

176
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:09,615
Okay.
Do you want the truth?

177
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:13,030
I don't think
you're the person for this.

178
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:14,731
Because you still
don't trust me.

179
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:16,399
Because you haven't
shown me I can.

180
00:06:17,402 --> 00:06:18,434
Okay, have it your way.

181
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,570
I'm sure Alex
will knock it out of the park.

182
00:06:20,605 --> 00:06:22,272
Oh wait,
he's too busy.

183
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:24,267
You could always try
one of those junior partners.

184
00:06:24,311 --> 00:06:25,488
Of course, they're all
too afraid of Robert

185
00:06:25,512 --> 00:06:27,512
to spend billable
hours on a pro Bono.

186
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:28,725
- Are you done?
- I don't know. Am I?

187
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:30,627
Not until you tell me why
you want this so much.

188
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:32,128
Well, if I told you
it's because I care

189
00:06:32,152 --> 00:06:34,330
about the work this charity
does you'd never believe me.

190
00:06:34,354 --> 00:06:35,820
So why don't we just say
it's because

191
00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:37,789
a little birdie asked me to.

192
00:06:37,824 --> 00:06:39,824
Okay, Samantha.

193
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,593
I'll send you their files.

194
00:06:46,856 --> 00:06:48,555
Brian, there you are.

195
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:49,768
I need your help
with something.

196
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:50,557
Sure, what is it?

197
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:51,458
Emmet Ford hit a roadblock

198
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,437
getting listed on
the stock exchange

199
00:06:53,438 --> 00:06:55,572
and we need to blow
that roadblock away.

200
00:06:55,607 --> 00:06:56,684
Whoa, whoa, Katrina,
whatever this is,

201
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,676
you can handle this yourself.

202
00:06:57,676 --> 00:06:58,632
Why are you coming
to me with it?

203
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:00,520
Three reasons.
One, you have more

204
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:02,354
stock exchange experience
than I do.

205
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,456
Two, I want a show of force.
And three?

206
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:06,292
Let's just say
Donna once said

207
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:07,927
that you make everyone
around you better.

208
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:11,597
And I need to be
at my best on this case.

209
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,399
- Then I accept.
- Then read up.

210
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:14,934
We're meeting them in an hour.

211
00:07:22,095 --> 00:07:24,028
Donna, just the person
I was about to come see.

212
00:07:24,063 --> 00:07:25,743
- Oh, is that a fact?
- You seem perturbed.

213
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,959
I am.
Because Samantha just asked

214
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,505
to represent my charity
and there's no way

215
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:31,028
she would have done that
if she hadn't

216
00:07:31,063 --> 00:07:33,831
heard about it from you.
Donna,

217
00:07:33,866 --> 00:07:34,799
you two got off on
the wrong foot,

218
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:36,700
and I know for a fact
she wants to fix it.

219
00:07:36,736 --> 00:07:37,635
And how do you know that?

220
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,847
Because when
I came to her with this

221
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:40,115
She said it'll kill two birds
with one stone,

222
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,332
and one of those birds
was making good with you.

223
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:46,377
Well, I still wish
you hadn't gone to her at all.

224
00:07:47,078 --> 00:07:48,838
Does that mean
I should tear up this check?

225
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:55,652
This is a donation
for $5 million.

226
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:56,697
That Samantha insisted I get

227
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:59,022
before she took on
your charity.

228
00:07:59,057 --> 00:08:01,791
Donna,
she's serious about this.

229
00:08:03,361 --> 00:08:05,361
Okay, Alex,
I'll give her a chance.

230
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:08,464
Thank you for this check.

231
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,020
Mr. Ford,
I'm Katrina Bennett.

232
00:08:17,055 --> 00:08:18,677
This is Brian Altman.
It's nice to meet you both.

233
00:08:18,678 --> 00:08:19,955
We've read up on
your situation,

234
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,613
but we want to hear it
directly from you.

235
00:08:22,648 --> 00:08:24,715
Okay, here it is.

236
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:27,518
I've spent the last six months

237
00:08:27,553 --> 00:08:29,687
trying to drum up interest
in our IPO.

238
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:31,249
And then at the eleventh hour,

239
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:33,884
the stock exchange
pulls a rug out from under me.

240
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,753
- Why would they do that?
- Ask Marc Aiken.

241
00:08:35,788 --> 00:08:37,121
The Chairman of the board?

242
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:38,255
Yeah.

243
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,124
The jackass has
had it in for me

244
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,393
ever since we worked together
at Goldman.

245
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:43,572
The board said
they pulled support

246
00:08:43,596 --> 00:08:46,209
because of concern over
our site's content,

247
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,177
but I know damn well...

248
00:08:48,212 --> 00:08:49,990
It's just a pretext
for Marc to screw you over.

249
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:51,046
Exactly.

250
00:08:51,082 --> 00:08:53,248
If I don't get
this infusion of capital,

251
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:54,645
I am dead in the water.

252
00:08:54,646 --> 00:08:55,842
Then all we need
to do is show

253
00:08:55,843 --> 00:08:57,586
this is bad faith
and you're in.

254
00:08:57,587 --> 00:08:58,631
And that shouldn't
be too hard.

255
00:08:58,655 --> 00:09:00,249
All we need
are those board minutes.

256
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,368
I tried that myself already;
they're sealed.

257
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:04,403
- Then we need to unseal them.
- How?

258
00:09:04,438 --> 00:09:05,571
By getting it on record

259
00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:07,906
that Marc Aiken
hates your guts.

260
00:09:09,176 --> 00:09:11,043
All right,
I understand we're here

261
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:12,377
because of a few blackheads.

262
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:15,013
So what's it gonna take
to get that video down?

263
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:18,083
My client's complexion
is her livelihood, Mr. Specter.

264
00:09:18,118 --> 00:09:20,485
Not only did this incident
harm her brand,

265
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:22,721
it brought her
emotional anguish.

266
00:09:22,756 --> 00:09:26,291
It was so bad I couldn't post
a video for a week.

267
00:09:26,617 --> 00:09:28,204
Except the one defaming
my client.

268
00:09:28,205 --> 00:09:31,573
Well, I had to show people
what it did to my face.

269
00:09:31,609 --> 00:09:33,342
It was shaming.

270
00:09:33,377 --> 00:09:35,477
Which is why in addition
to the video staying up

271
00:09:35,513 --> 00:09:37,212
we've prepared this.

272
00:09:40,851 --> 00:09:41,950
Listen to me,

273
00:09:41,986 --> 00:09:45,120
if every 16-year-old girl
filed suit every time

274
00:09:45,155 --> 00:09:47,222
she wasn't happy with
what she saw in the mirror,

275
00:09:47,258 --> 00:09:49,892
our legal system would
grind to a halt.

276
00:09:49,927 --> 00:09:53,128
I'm not every
16-year-old girl, Mr. Specter.

277
00:09:53,163 --> 00:09:56,064
And you want me to take down
that video and not file this?

278
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,433
I want $10 million.
I see.

279
00:09:58,469 --> 00:10:01,370
So this is a shakedown?
This is a legitimate claim,

280
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:02,938
and your wisest
course of action

281
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:04,373
would be to write that check.

282
00:10:04,785 --> 00:10:05,929
My course of action
is gonna be

283
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:07,886
to hit you with
a defamation suit

284
00:10:07,922 --> 00:10:09,139
because you have no proof

285
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,701
our product caused
your break outs.

286
00:10:10,702 --> 00:10:12,127
And I don't think
you understand

287
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:13,626
that I have
50 million followers

288
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:15,005
who will do anything
I tell them to.

289
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:16,864
So even if that video
comes down,

290
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:20,429
I can tell them not
to use your client anyway.

291
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,230
That's it.
I don't care how old you are.

292
00:10:22,265 --> 00:10:23,932
You know what you're doing.

293
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:25,278
You deserve
what's coming for you,

294
00:10:25,302 --> 00:10:27,769
and this meeting's over.

295
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:36,195
- Okay, Harvey.
- Okay, what?

296
00:10:36,196 --> 00:10:38,630
Okay.
Why don't you make your jokes

297
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:40,000
about me and Sheila
procreating so we can get

298
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:41,312
to you filling me in
on Joan's emergency.

299
00:10:41,336 --> 00:10:42,796
I don't need to fill you in,
Louis.

300
00:10:42,797 --> 00:10:45,106
I got it from here.
No, you don't have anything.

301
00:10:45,107 --> 00:10:46,485
You were just supposed
to babysit her.

302
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:48,689
That's the thing about
actually being at work, Louis.

303
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,184
Situations change
and you make adjustments.

304
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:53,778
This isn't a situation.
This is you taking my client.

305
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,568
And you were the one okay
with clients leaving

306
00:10:55,569 --> 00:10:56,589
if that's what they wanted.

307
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,923
So that's what this is about.

308
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,659
Your mad because I let Dominic
do what was best for him.

309
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,694
No, this is about
you left the office

310
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,363
to get
your girlfriend knocked up.

311
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:06,431
I started working a case,
and I'm gonna finish it.

312
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:07,544
Don't you bring
Sheila into this.

313
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:10,369
I didn't, Louis.
You did.

314
00:11:10,613 --> 00:11:12,054
Now, you listen to me closely

315
00:11:12,055 --> 00:11:13,374
'cause I'm not
gonna say this again.

316
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,675
Your services are no longer
needed on this case.

317
00:11:18,213 --> 00:11:21,214
Mr. Aiken, exactly how do you
feel about Emmet Ford?

318
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:23,116
- Ambivalent.
- Ambivalent?

319
00:11:23,151 --> 00:11:24,609
You worked together
for seven years.

320
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,776
Asked and answered.
Where is this going?

321
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,512
It's going to the fact
that your client

322
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:29,747
deliberately tried to sabotage

323
00:11:29,781 --> 00:11:32,783
Emmet Ford's IPO
because he doesn't like him.

324
00:11:32,784 --> 00:11:34,117
That's bullshit.

325
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,592
Really,
then why did you punch him?

326
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,886
- What?
- Why would you throw

327
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:38,621
a punch at someone
if you like them?

328
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,990
I didn't say I like him,
and that incident

329
00:11:41,026 --> 00:11:42,926
happened on
the trading floor at Goldman.

330
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:45,295
Throwing punches
was considered friendly.

331
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,607
I got to tell you, Marc,
it doesn't sound friendly.

332
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:47,530
I don't care
what it sounds like.

333
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:48,998
Then let me tell you
how it looks.

334
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:50,466
You had a fight;
you held a grudge;

335
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:51,367
and when you got
the chance to screw over

336
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:52,702
a man you hate,
you took it.

337
00:11:52,737 --> 00:11:53,937
I didn't screw him over.

338
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:55,505
But you do hate him,
don't you?

339
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,607
Okay, you know what?
I can't stand him.

340
00:11:57,642 --> 00:11:59,409
I think he's a sanctimonious
son of a bitch

341
00:11:59,444 --> 00:12:01,644
and if I never seem him again,
it'll be too soon,

342
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,581
but I did not
keep him off that exchange.

343
00:12:06,284 --> 00:12:08,124
Then if you're not going
to tell us the truth

344
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:10,286
about that,
the board minutes will.

345
00:12:10,322 --> 00:12:12,316
You have no right
to those minutes.

346
00:12:12,317 --> 00:12:14,390
We do, now that he's
admitted personal bias.

347
00:12:15,076 --> 00:12:16,842
So either we can subpoena
those minutes

348
00:12:16,877 --> 00:12:18,978
and show this tape
in open court,

349
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:20,613
or you can turn them
over today.

350
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:21,947
But you better decide fast

351
00:12:21,983 --> 00:12:24,617
because I've already drafted
that subpoena.

352
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:30,322
You'll have them
by the end of the day.

353
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:35,937
And then I said,
"It's not the same."

354
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:37,450
And then he said,
"Well, you're the one

355
00:12:37,474 --> 00:12:38,584
who's okay with clients
with leaving."

356
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:40,942
And then he brought up Sheila,
and then I got really mad,

357
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:42,488
and then I got really sad
and called you.

358
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:43,512
Now fix it.

359
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:46,614
Louis, customarily
I find your frustrations

360
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,217
with Harvey to be entirely
of your own making,

361
00:12:49,252 --> 00:12:51,219
but in this instance,

362
00:12:51,254 --> 00:12:53,922
it sounds like Harvey
may be the one in the wrong.

363
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:55,323
Holy shit,
I need to go out

364
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,291
and buy a lotto ticket
right now.

365
00:12:56,326 --> 00:12:59,127
Louis,
stay with me.

366
00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:00,915
You two have known each other
a long time.

367
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,616
You've had your ups and downs.

368
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:04,918
Yeah, I know, it's like
we're almost in a relationship.

369
00:13:04,954 --> 00:13:08,455
Not almost,
it is a relationship.

370
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,857
Oh, my God.

371
00:13:09,892 --> 00:13:12,492
I'm in a relationship
with Harvey.

372
00:13:12,528 --> 00:13:13,560
Can I be the boy?

373
00:13:13,596 --> 00:13:15,040
Oh, scratch that,
I don't even give a shit.

374
00:13:15,064 --> 00:13:16,697
I'm in a relationship
with Harvey.

375
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:18,832
And would you like to work
on that relationship?

376
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:20,634
Or spend the rest
of the session

377
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:21,568
celebrating its existence.

378
00:13:21,604 --> 00:13:23,215
I think we both know
the answer to that,

379
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:24,316
but I'll settle
for working on it.

380
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,273
In that case...

381
00:13:26,308 --> 00:13:28,242
what would Harvey say

382
00:13:28,277 --> 00:13:31,211
if you were to ask
him why he is so upset?

383
00:13:31,247 --> 00:13:32,646
I don't know.
He's Harvey.

384
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:33,580
He'd say, "I'm right.
You're wrong."

385
00:13:33,616 --> 00:13:35,949
Touch his hair and leave.
Louis.

386
00:13:35,985 --> 00:13:37,425
If you cannot see him
as human being,

387
00:13:37,453 --> 00:13:39,586
I cannot help you.

388
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:43,685
- What if I brought him in?
- Excuse me?

389
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:44,887
You do couple's counseling.

390
00:13:44,922 --> 00:13:46,833
What if I brought him in
to work on our relationship?

391
00:13:46,857 --> 00:13:48,557
That is not exactly
what I meant...

392
00:13:48,592 --> 00:13:50,759
- You just said we're a couple.
- I didn't say that.

393
00:13:50,794 --> 00:13:52,594
Well, then what did you say?

394
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,673
Because I don't know
what he's feeling,

395
00:13:53,697 --> 00:13:55,497
but I do know
that we need help.

396
00:13:58,135 --> 00:13:59,968
Okay, Louis.

397
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:04,006
If you can bring him in,
I'll help.

398
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:13,549
Did you finish reading
the minutes?

399
00:14:13,584 --> 00:14:15,284
Yes. I read them twice

400
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:16,959
to make sure
I wasn't missing anything.

401
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,993
Well, you didn't.
All these show

402
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:21,007
is hours of Aiken lobbying
to keep Emmet's business

403
00:14:21,031 --> 00:14:22,141
and everyone else lobbying
against him.

404
00:14:22,165 --> 00:14:23,898
I know. He set us up.

405
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:25,933
So we'd spend half
the day wasting our time

406
00:14:25,969 --> 00:14:27,935
while the clock on
that IPO is ticking.

407
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:29,804
Now I have to stay here
all night because

408
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,507
we're running out of time,
and I'm not losing this case.

409
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,909
Then I just have
one question.

410
00:14:34,944 --> 00:14:36,611
Indian or Chinese?

411
00:14:36,646 --> 00:14:39,280
Because if you're staying here
all night, I am too.

412
00:14:39,315 --> 00:14:41,416
Indian.

413
00:14:41,451 --> 00:14:43,451
Thanks, Brian.

414
00:14:44,254 --> 00:14:45,753
Don't you look nice.

415
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:48,123
We doing costume changes in
the middle of the day now?

416
00:14:48,124 --> 00:14:49,424
Okay, first of all,
it is not

417
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:50,992
the middle of the day,
and, second,

418
00:14:51,027 --> 00:14:52,593
I'm going to a gala
for the charity

419
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:54,195
that you said
you didn't have time for.

420
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,741
Well, if I'd known you
were gonna dress like that,

421
00:14:55,765 --> 00:14:56,731
I'd have made time.

422
00:14:56,766 --> 00:14:58,666
And if had known
that a married man

423
00:14:58,701 --> 00:14:59,712
was going to hit on me
at work, I would have

424
00:14:59,736 --> 00:15:00,935
served him with papers.

425
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,404
Come on, baby,
don't be like that.

426
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,607
Seriously, Donna, I'm glad it
worked out with Samantha.

427
00:15:06,643 --> 00:15:08,309
Thanks, Alex.

428
00:15:08,344 --> 00:15:10,311
I'm glad it did too.

429
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:19,161
Brian, I don't know
where you found this place,

430
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:23,688
but this is the best masala
I've had since college.

431
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,718
I just realized
this is, like, our third dinner

432
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:27,272
we've had together,
and I don't even know

433
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:28,806
where you went to college.

434
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:30,452
Well, if you must know,
I went to Princeton,

435
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:32,554
but before you can ask about
my major, I couldn't Dec...

436
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:33,911
Holy shit, Princeton.

437
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:34,712
Brian, it's not
that big a deal.

438
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:36,158
Everybody here went
to Harvard Law...

439
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:37,882
I'm not talking about that.

440
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:39,695
I'm talking about Tony Gold.
Who's Tony Gold?

441
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:42,119
He was my rival on
the debate team in high school.

442
00:15:42,155 --> 00:15:43,355
He knew Princeton was my dream

443
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:45,289
and that my parents couldn't
afford to send me

444
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:46,757
to the interview in person.

445
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:48,070
So Tony offered
to let me ride up

446
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:49,694
with his family
as an olive branch.

447
00:15:49,729 --> 00:15:51,206
- How'd the interview go?
- He never picked me up.

448
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,497
Princeton thought I'd bailed;
he got in; I didn't.

449
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:55,032
Brian, that's horrible.

450
00:15:55,068 --> 00:15:57,168
It is, but Tony came up
with a bullshit story

451
00:15:57,203 --> 00:15:59,704
about why they never showed,
and I believed him.

452
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:01,605
Until his little brother
told me the truth

453
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:02,840
a few months later.

454
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,542
What are you saying?

455
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:05,988
I'm saying Tony couldn't
keep it to himself.

456
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:07,556
Because when you do something
like that...

457
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,512
You have to tell someone.

458
00:16:08,548 --> 00:16:10,681
Which means all we need
to do is find

459
00:16:10,717 --> 00:16:12,650
Marc Aiken's little brother.

460
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:18,522
You got a little masala
on your...

461
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:21,325
Other side.

462
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:23,994
Your... here.

463
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,796
Let me get it.

464
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:30,101
What?

465
00:16:30,862 --> 00:16:32,106
I just made it
1,000 times worse.

466
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,463
You look like Ronald McDonald.

467
00:16:33,498 --> 00:16:35,865
I thought you do this with
your son, like, every day.

468
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,867
Well, I haven't had
to do it with him in months

469
00:16:37,902 --> 00:16:41,704
because his food is the train,
and he keeps it in the station.

470
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:43,840
- Ha ha, give me that napkin.
- No.

471
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,115
Not till after
I take a picture.

472
00:16:45,143 --> 00:16:46,843
No, you are not taking
a picture of me.

473
00:16:46,878 --> 00:16:48,122
Well, maybe you should
have thought of that

474
00:16:48,146 --> 00:16:50,513
before you let me wipe sauce
all over your face.

475
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:52,882
All right, I'll get it off.

476
00:16:58,723 --> 00:17:01,557
I don't think we should eat
anymore masala.

477
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:11,467
Donna, I cannot thank you
enough for your donation.

478
00:17:11,503 --> 00:17:12,913
You're already making such
a difference.

479
00:17:12,937 --> 00:17:14,315
Oh, please, Peggy,
you're the ones

480
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,416
making the real difference.

481
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,540
I'm just happy
I could help you do it.

482
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:21,288
Will you excuse me
for a minute?

483
00:17:21,312 --> 00:17:22,378
Sure.

484
00:17:25,698 --> 00:17:27,264
- Samantha.
- Donna.

485
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,144
I have to say I didn't expect
to see you here.

486
00:17:29,168 --> 00:17:30,934
I didn't expect to be here.

487
00:17:30,969 --> 00:17:33,214
Did you come to show me how
good you look all dressed up?

488
00:17:33,238 --> 00:17:36,039
What if I came to see how
good you look all dressed up?

489
00:17:36,075 --> 00:17:37,619
Miss Wheeler,
are you flirting with me?

490
00:17:37,643 --> 00:17:39,509
And how would
that make you feel if I was?

491
00:17:39,545 --> 00:17:41,611
Are you kidding?
I went to theater camp.

492
00:17:41,647 --> 00:17:42,746
Hm.

493
00:17:42,781 --> 00:17:45,282
But I would still like
to know why you're here.

494
00:17:45,317 --> 00:17:46,961
I mean, you don't strike me
as the kind of person

495
00:17:46,985 --> 00:17:49,504
who would come to an event like
this unless she had to.

496
00:17:49,505 --> 00:17:51,138
I wouldn't,
but if I'm gonna represent

497
00:17:51,173 --> 00:17:52,306
these people,
I need to know

498
00:17:52,341 --> 00:17:53,774
what they do
and how they do it.

499
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:55,220
While we're on
the subject of working,

500
00:17:55,244 --> 00:17:57,244
I got that check from Alex.

501
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,990
Is that your way of saying
you're good with me doing this?

502
00:17:59,014 --> 00:18:01,582
It is, but it's not just
because of the money.

503
00:18:01,617 --> 00:18:03,050
You're here showing interest.

504
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:04,529
That's just the kind
of representation

505
00:18:04,553 --> 00:18:06,120
this place needs.

506
00:18:06,155 --> 00:18:08,755
Well, in that case, maybe
we should hit up the food.

507
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,624
I may not have come
for the shrimp cocktail,

508
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:13,260
but I'm gonna eat the shit
out of some.

509
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:14,828
I've already had
16 oysters myself.

510
00:18:14,864 --> 00:18:17,664
17th won't hurt anybody.

511
00:18:22,797 --> 00:18:23,836
I don't know about you,

512
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:26,652
but not all the cocktails I
had last night were shrimp.

513
00:18:27,835 --> 00:18:29,635
Thank you, Donna.
You didn't have to.

514
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,204
Just like you didn't have
to take on this charity.

515
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,440
But I got the impression
from Alex that he saw

516
00:18:34,475 --> 00:18:35,486
a side of you that I hadn't,

517
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,844
and last night I think
I started to see it too.

518
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,080
Well, as long as
we're talking about last night,

519
00:18:41,115 --> 00:18:42,782
I may have found
something wrong.

520
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:44,183
What do you mean?

521
00:18:44,218 --> 00:18:46,685
I mean, charities typically
spend 5% of their budget

522
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:48,821
on fundraising,
but based on the disclosures

523
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:50,034
I got from your friend, Peggy,

524
00:18:50,058 --> 00:18:53,826
they've been at 5.3%
for the last five years.

525
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,943
Sound like
a simple rounding error.

526
00:18:55,979 --> 00:18:57,011
Donna.

527
00:18:57,046 --> 00:18:58,324
I have a nose for
this kind of thing,

528
00:18:58,348 --> 00:19:01,282
and I think Peggy
is up to something shady.

529
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:02,728
And the problem
with people who fix things

530
00:19:02,752 --> 00:19:05,889
is they can't stop looking
for problems to fix.

531
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:06,967
You think I'm making this up?

532
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:09,425
I think you're making .3%
into more than it is.

533
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,738
And I think the devil
is in the details,

534
00:19:10,762 --> 00:19:13,896
and I am telling you
this detail is trouble.

535
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:15,564
Okay.

536
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,588
If you're so sure,
I'll talk to Peggy.

537
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,633
Maybe I should be the one...

538
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,522
Samantha,
if my friend has been

539
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,592
lying to me,
I'm not gonna ignore it.

540
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,527
I'm gonna turn on
my spidey senses,

541
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,129
and I'm gonna find out
if you're right,

542
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:27,264
and what I want you to do

543
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,066
is not try to fix
this in the meantime.

544
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,802
Okay.
Let me know what you find.

545
00:19:40,915 --> 00:19:42,882
Harvey,
we need to talk

546
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:44,550
because our relationship
needs tending.

547
00:19:44,586 --> 00:19:46,336
Our what needs what?

548
00:19:46,337 --> 00:19:47,069
You heard me.
We're in a relationship,

549
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,270
and it's not working.

550
00:19:48,305 --> 00:19:49,538
Then break up with me

551
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:50,996
and go out with somebody else
'cause I'm busy.

552
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,208
Harvey, I am serious.
We're partners.

553
00:19:53,244 --> 00:19:54,555
We need to work on
our relationship,

554
00:19:54,556 --> 00:19:55,822
and we need help doing it.

555
00:19:55,857 --> 00:19:56,936
Louis, what exactly
are you getting at?

556
00:19:56,937 --> 00:19:58,485
- Dr. Lipschitz.
- Your therapist?

557
00:19:58,486 --> 00:19:59,563
- Yeah, and he agreed...
- No.

558
00:19:59,587 --> 00:20:00,908
- But...
- Louis, there's no way

559
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,076
I'm going to a session
with your therapist.

560
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,354
Actually it would be
for the both of us.

561
00:20:04,378 --> 00:20:05,344
Are you fucking kidding me?

562
00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:06,744
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

563
00:20:06,745 --> 00:20:07,989
Well,
he thinks it's a good idea.

564
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:11,047
Which just goes to show
that he's an idiot,

565
00:20:11,082 --> 00:20:12,527
and so are you.
Don't turn this on me

566
00:20:12,551 --> 00:20:13,795
and don't talk about him
that way.

567
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:15,118
What's going on here?

568
00:20:15,153 --> 00:20:17,520
Harvey won't go to
couple's counseling with me.

569
00:20:17,556 --> 00:20:18,455
- What?
- Exactly.

570
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,789
No, not exactly.

571
00:20:19,825 --> 00:20:22,492
Because you took my client;
you're upset about Dominic;

572
00:20:22,527 --> 00:20:24,828
you insulted me, my therapist,
and the woman I love.

573
00:20:24,863 --> 00:20:25,695
And none of that
would have happened

574
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,596
if you put the needs
of this firm

575
00:20:26,631 --> 00:20:28,498
over your afternoon delight.

576
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:29,866
And here we go again.

577
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:31,434
Louis,
will you give us a minute?

578
00:20:35,707 --> 00:20:37,480
Donna, I don't want
to talk about this.

579
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:39,081
Too bad,
because I heard the way

580
00:20:39,116 --> 00:20:40,880
you spoke to Louis before
and just now,

581
00:20:40,881 --> 00:20:42,781
and there's clearly
stuff going on with you

582
00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:43,982
that you're not dealing with.

583
00:20:44,017 --> 00:20:45,061
Probably has something
to do with

584
00:20:45,085 --> 00:20:46,262
what you just went through
with Marcus.

585
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,636
This has nothing to do
with him getting a divorce.

586
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,323
He's what?

587
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:51,524
He called.

588
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:53,352
They're not gonna try
to work it out.

589
00:20:54,384 --> 00:20:56,284
Well, I don't care
if you go see Lipschitz

590
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,386
or someone else, but you need
to deal with yourself.

591
00:20:58,422 --> 00:21:00,221
And stop treating Louis
like you used to

592
00:21:00,257 --> 00:21:02,190
because he's not
that man anymore.

593
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:03,958
And I thought you were neither.

594
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,782
- Okay, thanks for your time.
- Anything?

595
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:13,749
Nothing.

596
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:15,851
That was the 15th person
I've called

597
00:21:15,887 --> 00:21:17,620
that knows Marc Aiken,
and no one says

598
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:19,355
they're anything more
than an acquaintance.

599
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,667
That tracks with
what Emmet told me.

600
00:21:20,691 --> 00:21:22,625
The man has no friends,
no family,

601
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,650
just a bunch of associates
who can barely stand him.

602
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:25,929
The guy I just talked to
said he's got

603
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:27,652
a standing tee time
at Quaker Ridge

604
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:29,554
for the sole purpose of
advancing his career.

605
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,622
I bet it works.

606
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:32,657
My father would tolerate
anyone to play there.

607
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:35,293
- Your dad's a golfer?
- Yeah. I am too, actually.

608
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:36,828
Huh, I had no idea.

609
00:21:36,864 --> 00:21:39,164
Well, I don't get to play
as much as I'd like.

610
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,167
Wait a second.
What?

611
00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:43,568
If he has
a standing tee time,

612
00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:45,137
he has a standing caddy.

613
00:21:45,172 --> 00:21:47,139
And a caddy might not
be someone he confides in,

614
00:21:47,174 --> 00:21:49,040
but if all he ever talks
about is business...

615
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:50,253
We need to get
to Quaker Ridge.

616
00:21:50,277 --> 00:21:51,943
Let's go.
You go.

617
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:53,156
We're running out of time,
and if you get something,

618
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,981
we're going to need a complaint
ready to file with the SCC.

619
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:06,094
Oh, Harvey,
if you are here to tell me

620
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:07,595
that you think
another of my ideas is stupid...

621
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,066
I'm not here
to tell you that, Louis.

622
00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:12,769
I'm here to say I'll go see
Lipschitz with you.

623
00:22:12,804 --> 00:22:14,582
Do you really mean that,
or is this gonna be

624
00:22:14,606 --> 00:22:16,083
like the time that you said
you would take me to dinner

625
00:22:16,107 --> 00:22:17,974
for my 35th birthday
,and you never showed up.

626
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:19,876
It's not gonna be
like that time.

627
00:22:19,911 --> 00:22:22,612
- And what about the time...
- Not that time either.

628
00:22:22,647 --> 00:22:25,081
I'll show up for this.
I promise.

629
00:22:25,116 --> 00:22:26,560
And that's exactly what you
said the time...

630
00:22:26,584 --> 00:22:27,995
Louis, if you mention
one more time,

631
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:30,086
it will be like
all those times.

632
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:32,922
Then I want you to know
that I really appreciate

633
00:22:32,957 --> 00:22:34,557
you doing this, Harvey.
And to save time

634
00:22:34,592 --> 00:22:35,870
when we get there,
you should know that I sit

635
00:22:35,894 --> 00:22:37,627
on the left-hand side
of the couch.

636
00:22:37,662 --> 00:22:39,329
Fine.

637
00:22:39,364 --> 00:22:40,474
And I probably don't need
to tell you this,

638
00:22:40,498 --> 00:22:42,265
but you don't have
to bring your own tissues.

639
00:22:42,804 --> 00:22:44,370
Why would I bring
my own tissues?

640
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:46,350
Because we're gonna be doing
some deep work, Harvey.

641
00:22:46,374 --> 00:22:47,941
So if you need to have
a good cry,

642
00:22:47,976 --> 00:22:49,086
I just want you to know
that you're safe,

643
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,944
and I will not judge you.

644
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,586
See you there, Louis.

645
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,639
Wait, do you think
we should hug now

646
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,606
to set the tone
or do it after...

647
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:57,475
okay, we'll do it after.
Good call.

648
00:23:04,985 --> 00:23:05,917
Hey, what are you doing?

649
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:07,986
Don't act like
you don't know, Donna.

650
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:09,120
I've been fired.

651
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:10,388
What? How could I know that?

652
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:12,323
Because it happened after
Samantha Wheeler

653
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,359
called my CEO and put
a stop payment on that check.

654
00:23:15,262 --> 00:23:17,162
Peggy, you have got
to believe me.

655
00:23:17,197 --> 00:23:19,831
I had nothing to do with that.
What difference does it make?

656
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:22,100
My boss blamed me for
getting us involved with you,

657
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:24,102
and he fired me.
That's bullshit.

658
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:25,970
What's bullshit
is that I trusted you.

659
00:23:26,006 --> 00:23:26,805
And now I'm out on my ass.

660
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,640
You can still trust me,
Peggy.

661
00:23:30,043 --> 00:23:31,943
I swear I'm gonna
make this right.

662
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:36,381
What the hell
is wrong with you?

663
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,816
Donna...

664
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:39,562
I specifically told you
not to do anything

665
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:40,630
until you heard from me,
and you said you wouldn't.

666
00:23:40,654 --> 00:23:42,520
I said I'd let you
talk to Peggy, and I did.

667
00:23:42,556 --> 00:23:44,289
After you called up her boss,

668
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:46,817
put a stop payment on
that check, and got her fired.

669
00:23:46,818 --> 00:23:48,329
I didn't call her boss
to get her fired.

670
00:23:48,353 --> 00:23:50,739
I called because I decided
to trust your judgment.

671
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,712
What is that
supposed to mean?

672
00:23:51,713 --> 00:23:53,555
It means I asked myself,
"What if Donna's right?"

673
00:23:53,556 --> 00:23:55,324
What if the only thing
going on is some vendors

674
00:23:55,325 --> 00:23:56,502
taking advantage of a charity.

675
00:23:56,526 --> 00:23:59,649
So I called up the CEO
and offered a solution.

676
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,084
And he said, "No, thanks,
we like our current situation."

677
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,420
So you ran a stress test
after I told you not to.

678
00:24:05,456 --> 00:24:07,155
I called a client
and made a suggestion.

679
00:24:07,191 --> 00:24:10,125
- Don't bullshit me.
- Okay, fine.

680
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,693
It was a test,

681
00:24:11,728 --> 00:24:14,930
but I'm not gonna let
a client donate $5 million

682
00:24:14,965 --> 00:24:16,619
to anyone without knowing
what's what.

683
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,186
So I killed two birds
with one stone.

684
00:24:18,222 --> 00:24:19,532
Which is exactly
what you said to Alex

685
00:24:19,556 --> 00:24:21,289
and making good with me
was supposed to be

686
00:24:21,325 --> 00:24:22,257
one of those birds.

687
00:24:22,292 --> 00:24:23,525
God damn it, Donna,

688
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,360
why don't you ever seem
to believe me?

689
00:24:25,395 --> 00:24:27,207
Maybe because you never
give anyone the full story.

690
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:28,496
You want the full story?

691
00:24:28,532 --> 00:24:31,633
They are stealing money
from little girls.

692
00:24:31,668 --> 00:24:32,879
Maybe that doesn't
matter to you,

693
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:34,369
but it sure as hell
as matters to me.

694
00:24:34,404 --> 00:24:37,505
You don't know
what matters to me.

695
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:39,074
And there are about
500 different ways

696
00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:40,820
you could have handled this,
and you picked the one

697
00:24:40,844 --> 00:24:42,444
that cost me my friend.

698
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:44,045
So as far as I'm concerned,

699
00:24:44,081 --> 00:24:46,081
I was right about you
all along.

700
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,231
Now that we've made
our introductions,

701
00:24:54,854 --> 00:24:56,796
I'd like to start with Harvey

702
00:24:56,797 --> 00:24:58,230
describing what he thinks

703
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:00,566
Louis' perspective
is on the situation.

704
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:01,834
I don't feel comfortable...

705
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:04,670
Please, just say the first
thoughts that come to mind.

706
00:25:04,705 --> 00:25:06,639
About how Louis thinks?

707
00:25:06,674 --> 00:25:09,708
Huh.
Let's see...

708
00:25:09,744 --> 00:25:12,545
Cats, ballet, Harvey Specter.
Something like that.

709
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,624
That is not
what I sound like.

710
00:25:13,648 --> 00:25:14,680
All right, Louis.

711
00:25:14,715 --> 00:25:17,783
You wanna know
what you sound like to me?

712
00:25:18,314 --> 00:25:21,849
"I've been jealous
of you since day one.

713
00:25:21,885 --> 00:25:24,886
"You were always Jessica's
favorite and everyone else's.

714
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:27,789
"You got everything I wanted
without ever trying.

715
00:25:27,824 --> 00:25:28,901
"In fact,
I'm trying to have a baby

716
00:25:28,925 --> 00:25:32,660
"because, I-I-I think it will
take my mind off you

717
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:35,902
even though I know
deep inside it won't."

718
00:25:36,026 --> 00:25:37,225
Tell him to stop.

719
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,571
He's being honest about
his feelings, Louis.

720
00:25:38,572 --> 00:25:39,683
What about
your feelings about

721
00:25:39,707 --> 00:25:40,759
who's fault
this whole thing was?

722
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,626
- Louis.
- What?

723
00:25:41,661 --> 00:25:42,705
I should have known
you just wanted

724
00:25:42,729 --> 00:25:45,663
to get me in here

725
00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:47,109
to have him tell me
this is my fault.

726
00:25:47,133 --> 00:25:48,232
It is your fault.

727
00:25:48,268 --> 00:25:49,378
Louis, we are not here
to discuss fault.

728
00:25:49,402 --> 00:25:50,780
Well,
then why the hell are we here?

729
00:25:50,804 --> 00:25:52,754
Because he took my client;
he won't give her back;

730
00:25:52,755 --> 00:25:54,615
and he needs to apologize
about what he just said

731
00:25:54,616 --> 00:25:55,480
about me having a baby.

732
00:25:55,481 --> 00:25:58,180
I am not apologizing
about anything.

733
00:25:58,216 --> 00:25:59,482
You wanted me to come here.

734
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:01,317
You said this was a safe place.

735
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:02,985
And now you can't handle

736
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:04,565
what I think about
you trying to have a baby.

737
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:05,599
Oh, no, you don't get
to make this my fault.

738
00:26:05,623 --> 00:26:07,223
Because it's always my fault,

739
00:26:07,258 --> 00:26:08,569
but I thought this time
we could come here

740
00:26:08,593 --> 00:26:10,426
so you could tell him
that it's his fault,

741
00:26:10,461 --> 00:26:11,994
but if all you're gonna do
is mock me

742
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,796
and all you're gonna do
is coddle him,

743
00:26:13,831 --> 00:26:15,109
well, then you can keep
Joan Walsh;

744
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:16,265
you can go to hell;

745
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,100
and this whole session is over.

746
00:26:23,188 --> 00:26:25,088
Well,
this was a waste of time.

747
00:26:26,492 --> 00:26:29,526
Maybe so,
but for what it's worth...

748
00:26:30,763 --> 00:26:33,297
I think you have some things
you could work on.

749
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:36,433
And provided Louis was okay...

750
00:26:36,468 --> 00:26:38,936
I'd be happy to talk
with you any time.

751
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,993
Alex,

752
00:26:46,028 --> 00:26:47,305
I need you to reverse
that stop payment.

753
00:26:47,329 --> 00:26:48,762
What?

754
00:26:48,797 --> 00:26:50,408
I said I need you
to call up that client

755
00:26:50,432 --> 00:26:51,643
and tell them to let
that donation go through.

756
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:52,633
Well, I'm not gonna do that

757
00:26:52,668 --> 00:26:54,434
because Samantha told me
what's going on.

758
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,747
Samantha doesn't know
what's going on,

759
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:57,437
and you were wrong
to involve her.

760
00:26:57,473 --> 00:26:58,783
- So this is about me.
- No, this is about the fact

761
00:26:58,807 --> 00:27:00,540
that my friend just got fired.

762
00:27:00,576 --> 00:27:02,187
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,
Donna, but I can't help you.

763
00:27:02,211 --> 00:27:04,211
Then don't help me.
Help the charity.

764
00:27:04,246 --> 00:27:06,324
Because you're taking money
away from people who need it.

765
00:27:06,348 --> 00:27:08,081
Donna,
if I do what you're asking

766
00:27:08,117 --> 00:27:10,195
I might as well tell my clients
they can't trust my advice.

767
00:27:10,219 --> 00:27:12,030
And my advice to you
is get your head on straight.

768
00:27:12,054 --> 00:27:13,164
You're saying I'm not seeing
this clearly.

769
00:27:13,188 --> 00:27:15,522
I'm saying Samantha
specializes in shady shit.

770
00:27:15,557 --> 00:27:16,923
So if she suspects
something's up

771
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:18,792
you might not believe it,
but I do.

772
00:27:18,827 --> 00:27:20,667
And I'm not cutting
that charity another check.

773
00:27:35,385 --> 00:27:38,119
- Almost done?
- Oh.

774
00:27:38,155 --> 00:27:40,321
Sorry, Katrina.
That's okay.

775
00:27:40,357 --> 00:27:42,068
I take it you were thinking
about something.

776
00:27:42,092 --> 00:27:43,258
To tell you the truth,

777
00:27:43,293 --> 00:27:45,193
I actually came in here
to think.

778
00:27:45,228 --> 00:27:46,439
But I've hogged
this thing long enough.

779
00:27:46,463 --> 00:27:48,363
It's all yours.

780
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:50,209
As long as you're here,
do you mind

781
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:51,566
if I ask you a question?

782
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:53,068
Of course, what is it?

783
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,557
Louis said if I win this case

784
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:57,092
I'll finally make
senior partner, but...

785
00:27:57,128 --> 00:27:58,560
He's said that before,

786
00:27:58,596 --> 00:28:00,496
and you wanna know
if this time it's true?

787
00:28:00,531 --> 00:28:01,964
I do.

788
00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:04,133
Then the answer is yes.

789
00:28:04,168 --> 00:28:06,268
It is.

790
00:28:06,303 --> 00:28:08,037
Thanks, Donna.

791
00:28:10,408 --> 00:28:12,941
As long as you're here,

792
00:28:12,977 --> 00:28:15,144
do you mind
if I ask you something?

793
00:28:17,048 --> 00:28:19,148
What's going on with
you and Brian?

794
00:28:19,917 --> 00:28:20,783
What?

795
00:28:20,818 --> 00:28:22,618
I noticed when the two of you

796
00:28:22,653 --> 00:28:24,097
were working together
last night you seemed

797
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:26,288
to have gotten...

798
00:28:26,721 --> 00:28:28,388
closer.

799
00:28:29,391 --> 00:28:32,092
We have.
We've become friends.

800
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,160
Looks like you might be
becoming more than that.

801
00:28:34,196 --> 00:28:35,895
Donna, he's married.

802
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:37,997
He has a son.
I would never do it.

803
00:28:38,033 --> 00:28:39,766
I know,
but I also know that the heart

804
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,568
doesn't always listen
to what the brain says

805
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:44,237
it would never do.

806
00:28:44,272 --> 00:28:46,139
Well,
you don't need to worry

807
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:49,309
because I don't feel anything
for Brian except friendship.

808
00:28:50,445 --> 00:28:53,113
Then good luck with the case.

809
00:28:54,011 --> 00:28:55,677
Copier's all yours.

810
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:09,642
So what do you want do now,
Stan?

811
00:29:09,643 --> 00:29:11,309
Tell me Drake the Snake
was my fault too?

812
00:29:11,344 --> 00:29:14,279
Louis, I know our session
didn't go as planned,

813
00:29:14,314 --> 00:29:17,415
but I do think there
is still some hope.

814
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:19,784
So...

815
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,885
<i>I'd like your blessing</i>

816
00:29:20,921 --> 00:29:23,221
<i>to begin seeing Harvey
one on one.</i>

817
00:29:23,256 --> 00:29:25,868
What? Are you fucking kidding me?
You're choosing his side again?

818
00:29:25,892 --> 00:29:27,845
I am not choosing his side,
Louis.

819
00:29:27,846 --> 00:29:29,512
I am trying to help
both of you.

820
00:29:29,547 --> 00:29:31,225
No, you're not,
because anyone who has a choice

821
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:33,549
between Harvey and me
always chooses him.

822
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:35,162
You know it's my biggest fear,
and you made it out

823
00:29:35,186 --> 00:29:36,586
like it was all my fault.

824
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:38,288
No, I didn't,

825
00:29:38,323 --> 00:29:39,756
and I stand by my assessment.

826
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:41,724
There are aspects
of this situation

827
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,459
that are of Harvey's making.

828
00:29:43,495 --> 00:29:45,439
Well, then why didn't you say
that to him, Stan?

829
00:29:45,463 --> 00:29:48,231
<i>Because, Louis,
when someone is hurting,</i>

830
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:50,767
<i>you don't throw stones
at them.</i>

831
00:29:50,802 --> 00:29:52,368
What do you mean
Harvey's hurting?

832
00:29:52,404 --> 00:29:55,838
I mean, people lash out
when they are in pain.

833
00:29:55,874 --> 00:29:59,090
He lashed out at you,
and if you care about

834
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:03,327
your relationship with him,
you will let me do my job.

835
00:30:03,362 --> 00:30:05,173
What if I don't care about
my relationship with him,

836
00:30:05,197 --> 00:30:06,274
and I'd rather keep you
to myself?

837
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:08,599
<i>Louis, I know
how much you care</i>

838
00:30:08,634 --> 00:30:10,501
<i>about Harvey
even when he hurts you.</i>

839
00:30:10,536 --> 00:30:14,972
That is something I have always
admired about you,

840
00:30:15,007 --> 00:30:18,342
and I do not think you should
take it lightly.

841
00:30:18,377 --> 00:30:19,843
All right,
he can see you,

842
00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:21,545
but he doesn't have
my blessing.

843
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,284
Katrina, I talked
to Aiken's caddy.

844
00:30:27,963 --> 00:30:30,497
I tried every trick
in the book. He froze me out.

845
00:30:30,533 --> 00:30:32,310
We didn't just get
frozen out, Brian.

846
00:30:32,311 --> 00:30:33,177
They slapped us
with a countersuit

847
00:30:33,212 --> 00:30:35,312
for slandering Marc.
We just made it

848
00:30:35,347 --> 00:30:37,347
1,000 times worse.
Shit.

849
00:30:37,383 --> 00:30:40,451
- Look, maybe we can still...
- I can't fucking believe it!

850
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,888
Katrina, it's just a case.

851
00:30:44,924 --> 00:30:46,857
No, it's not just a case.

852
00:30:46,892 --> 00:30:48,859
It's my senior partnership.
What?

853
00:30:48,894 --> 00:30:50,839
But I thought Louis said...
I know what he said,

854
00:30:50,863 --> 00:30:52,796
but there was a hitch.

855
00:30:54,363 --> 00:30:56,697
This was the case
to put me over the top.

856
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:01,602
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because it's my career

857
00:31:01,637 --> 00:31:03,337
and my responsibility.

858
00:31:03,372 --> 00:31:04,449
Katrina,
I'm not just the other name

859
00:31:04,473 --> 00:31:07,174
on this lawsuit;
I'm your friend.

860
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:11,366
If senior partner's on the line
for you, it is for me too.

861
00:31:11,367 --> 00:31:12,499
Now, we can still...

862
00:31:12,535 --> 00:31:15,102
Not just a name on a lawsuit.

863
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:19,106
- That's it.
- What's it?

864
00:31:19,141 --> 00:31:21,508
The attorney of record
on this suit isn't

865
00:31:21,544 --> 00:31:23,544
the same attorney
Aiken took the deposition with.

866
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:25,057
He changed lawyers in
the middle of the case.

867
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:25,946
What are you getting at?

868
00:31:25,982 --> 00:31:27,982
They sent back
the deposition last night

869
00:31:28,017 --> 00:31:30,656
and the new guy signed it.
Brian, it's one thing

870
00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:32,324
to have him handle
the slander case,

871
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,658
but to sign off
on a deposition.

872
00:31:33,694 --> 00:31:35,227
Holy shit.

873
00:31:35,262 --> 00:31:36,339
The first guy knew
Aiken was lying,

874
00:31:36,363 --> 00:31:39,331
and he wouldn't sign it.
He wouldn't suborn perjury.

875
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:41,132
Katrina, we got him.

876
00:31:41,168 --> 00:31:43,168
I know.

877
00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:44,469
Okay.

878
00:31:44,504 --> 00:31:46,304
We're going to get that tape.

879
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,517
We're gonna look
at his reaction

880
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:49,107
when Aiken says he's innocent.

881
00:31:49,142 --> 00:31:51,005
We're gonna find out
their entire history together.

882
00:31:51,006 --> 00:31:52,706
I don't care
if it takes all night.

883
00:31:52,741 --> 00:31:54,693
This is fantastic.
I'm gonna go order that masala;

884
00:31:54,694 --> 00:31:55,838
you're gonna get it all
over your face;

885
00:31:55,862 --> 00:31:57,406
I'm not even gonna tell you
about it this time.

886
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,629
You better tell me about it

887
00:31:58,665 --> 00:31:59,709
just like you better
get extra naan.

888
00:31:59,733 --> 00:32:01,032
Triple supreme naan it is.

889
00:32:01,067 --> 00:32:03,045
I'm just gonna go order it,
call my wife real quick

890
00:32:03,069 --> 00:32:04,613
to tell her not to wait up,
and then you and I...

891
00:32:04,637 --> 00:32:06,904
Wait, stop.
No.

892
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,773
No what?

893
00:32:08,808 --> 00:32:10,608
You're not staying tonight.

894
00:32:10,643 --> 00:32:13,411
I can handle this myself,
and I'm going to.

895
00:32:15,382 --> 00:32:17,782
Katrina, what's going on?
Did I do something wrong?

896
00:32:17,817 --> 00:32:20,318
You've done nothing wrong,
Brian.

897
00:32:20,353 --> 00:32:23,054
But you've got a wife
and a baby,

898
00:32:23,089 --> 00:32:24,367
and I'm not going
to keep you from them

899
00:32:24,391 --> 00:32:26,324
anymore than I already have.

900
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:28,359
Katrina, I told you
if your partnership's

901
00:32:28,395 --> 00:32:30,428
on the line,
my partnership's on the line.

902
00:32:30,463 --> 00:32:33,164
I know, but I got this.

903
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:35,724
Go home.

904
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,756
You mind if I come in?

905
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:50,657
No.

906
00:32:50,693 --> 00:32:51,625
I was just about
to come see you.

907
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,527
Well, before you tell me why,

908
00:32:53,562 --> 00:32:55,696
I'd like to apologize.

909
00:32:55,731 --> 00:32:58,465
You would?

910
00:32:58,501 --> 00:33:00,434
Yes.

911
00:33:00,469 --> 00:33:03,537
I realized
I'm too close to this.

912
00:33:03,572 --> 00:33:06,406
And instead of hearing you,
I lashed out, and I'm sorry.

913
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,976
You realized?

914
00:33:09,011 --> 00:33:10,377
I went to see Alex.

915
00:33:10,412 --> 00:33:11,311
Well, that's funny,

916
00:33:11,347 --> 00:33:14,448
because I wanted
to apologize too.

917
00:33:14,483 --> 00:33:16,483
You wanted to apologize?

918
00:33:18,587 --> 00:33:21,188
Donna, I told you
I wouldn't take action,

919
00:33:21,223 --> 00:33:25,125
and I shouldn't have.
But I couldn't help myself.

920
00:33:25,161 --> 00:33:27,261
because I care about
the kids this charity

921
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,730
is supposed to serve.

922
00:33:29,765 --> 00:33:31,865
But you wouldn't know that,
because like you said,

923
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:33,834
I never tell anyone
the full story.

924
00:33:33,869 --> 00:33:35,247
And the reason
I never tell the full story

925
00:33:35,271 --> 00:33:37,604
is because I just don't trust...

926
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,640
People.

927
00:33:39,675 --> 00:33:42,242
Pretty much.
Yeah.

928
00:33:44,133 --> 00:33:45,677
Alex talked to you after
he talked to me, didn't he?

929
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:47,367
He did.

930
00:33:47,403 --> 00:33:48,713
We might have to do something
about that guy.

931
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:50,504
We might.

932
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:53,106
But not before we do something
about this situation.

933
00:33:53,142 --> 00:33:55,446
Because I'm not gonna
let them get away

934
00:33:55,563 --> 00:33:56,863
with scamming children.

935
00:33:56,898 --> 00:33:58,598
I'm with you on that.

936
00:33:58,633 --> 00:34:00,800
Then let me ask.

937
00:34:00,835 --> 00:34:02,602
You read people.

938
00:34:02,637 --> 00:34:04,904
Are you absolutely sure
Peggy wasn't in on this,

939
00:34:04,939 --> 00:34:07,340
because they could have
fired her even if she was.

940
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:09,976
I am 100% sure.

941
00:34:11,713 --> 00:34:13,613
Then I know what to do.

942
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:18,681
I'm glad you decided
to come in.

943
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:20,682
You mind if I ask how

944
00:34:20,718 --> 00:34:21,862
you got Louis to agree
to let me see you?

945
00:34:21,886 --> 00:34:25,894
I don't,
but I would prefer to ask:

946
00:34:25,895 --> 00:34:28,355
when Louis came in
and said you were losing

947
00:34:28,356 --> 00:34:32,025
this McKernon Motors,
how did you feel?

948
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,760
You want to just
jump right in, huh?

949
00:34:33,795 --> 00:34:34,894
Yes, I do.

950
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:37,196
Well, how do you think
I felt? I didn't like it.

951
00:34:37,232 --> 00:34:38,843
Because you were losing
your oldest client?

952
00:34:38,867 --> 00:34:39,932
Because Louis told me

953
00:34:39,968 --> 00:34:41,901
there was nothing
I could do about it.

954
00:34:41,936 --> 00:34:44,637
And then Donna came in
and said Joan was there,

955
00:34:44,673 --> 00:34:46,706
and Louis couldn't even
take care of her.

956
00:34:46,741 --> 00:34:49,742
- And it irritated you?
- It infuriated me.

957
00:34:49,778 --> 00:34:51,811
- Why?
- Because he told me

958
00:34:51,846 --> 00:34:53,513
that I couldn't have
what I wanted

959
00:34:53,548 --> 00:34:55,849
and then he put
his own selfish interests

960
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,082
above the firm's.

961
00:34:57,118 --> 00:34:58,784
Forgive me, Harvey,

962
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,986
but isn't that Louis'
historical concern about you?

963
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,274
This is different.

964
00:35:02,275 --> 00:35:03,484
I think perhaps
it is different

965
00:35:03,508 --> 00:35:05,542
because he is the one
doing it to you,

966
00:35:05,577 --> 00:35:07,243
and more importantly,

967
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:09,915
what those
selfish interests are.

968
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:10,946
What are you getting at?

969
00:35:10,947 --> 00:35:13,114
When you two were here,
you spent

970
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,916
quite a lot of time
on Louis having a baby.

971
00:35:14,951 --> 00:35:16,718
So?

972
00:35:16,753 --> 00:35:19,287
So would you ever want
to have a baby? Or a family?

973
00:35:19,323 --> 00:35:20,989
I have a family,
and if you're gonna say

974
00:35:21,024 --> 00:35:22,802
this has something to do
with my brother's divorce...

975
00:35:22,826 --> 00:35:25,193
I didn't even know your
brother was getting a divorce.

976
00:35:25,228 --> 00:35:26,995
Well, he is.

977
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,597
- That must be painful.
- Of course it's painful.

978
00:35:29,633 --> 00:35:32,000
My family's falling apart,
and at the same time

979
00:35:32,035 --> 00:35:33,468
I'm getting it rubbed
in my face

980
00:35:33,503 --> 00:35:35,904
that Louis' family is growing.

981
00:35:38,108 --> 00:35:41,609
Forgive me, Harvey,
but...

982
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:44,831
Louis did not rub anything
in your face.

983
00:35:45,834 --> 00:35:46,766
No, he didn't.

984
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:48,968
But perhaps it feels that way

985
00:35:49,004 --> 00:35:51,471
because for the first time,

986
00:35:51,506 --> 00:35:54,046
Louis has something
in his life that you do not.

987
00:35:54,047 --> 00:35:56,537
Jesus Christ, you're saying
I'm envious of Louis.

988
00:35:56,538 --> 00:35:57,376
And what if you were?

989
00:35:57,377 --> 00:35:59,779
I'd ask what in God's name
am I supposed to do with that?

990
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,658
Does is it occur to you
to share that with him?

991
00:36:01,682 --> 00:36:04,015
No, even if I wanted to,
he's pissed off at me.

992
00:36:04,051 --> 00:36:05,650
He would forgive you
in a moment.

993
00:36:05,686 --> 00:36:08,453
And even if he did,
I'm afraid to...

994
00:36:08,488 --> 00:36:09,821
To what, Harvey?

995
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,606
Louis makes space
for the people

996
00:36:11,641 --> 00:36:13,241
in his life whom he loves.

997
00:36:13,276 --> 00:36:15,643
He makes space for people
like Sheila and a baby,

998
00:36:15,678 --> 00:36:16,877
but...
But what?

999
00:36:16,913 --> 00:36:18,179
But once he has that baby,

1000
00:36:18,214 --> 00:36:21,415
he might not make space for me.

1001
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:24,518
Where would you get
a notion like that,

1002
00:36:24,554 --> 00:36:26,887
that Louis wouldn't
have time for you?

1003
00:36:26,923 --> 00:36:30,491
Because they leave.
Everyone leaves:

1004
00:36:30,526 --> 00:36:34,495
Mike, Rachel, Jessica,
my sister-in-law.

1005
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,767
Everyone.

1006
00:36:39,802 --> 00:36:42,403
Well, I can tell you

1007
00:36:42,438 --> 00:36:44,772
if you keep treating
Louis like this,

1008
00:36:44,807 --> 00:36:46,874
you may cause him
to leave yourself.

1009
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,480
James Davenport?
I'm Donna Paulsen,

1010
00:36:54,516 --> 00:36:57,116
and this is my colleague
Samantha Wheeler.

1011
00:36:57,152 --> 00:36:58,785
The same Samantha Wheeler

1012
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,720
that had a $5 million donation
yanked from us?

1013
00:37:00,755 --> 00:37:02,622
The Samantha Wheeler
who offered you a venue

1014
00:37:02,657 --> 00:37:04,490
for your next event
for a fraction of the one

1015
00:37:04,526 --> 00:37:06,659
you've been using,
and you said no.

1016
00:37:06,695 --> 00:37:08,895
Which means you cut a deal
with your current venue

1017
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,464
where you overpay and they
kick back a percentage to you.

1018
00:37:11,499 --> 00:37:13,800
Specifically,
.3% of your annual budget.

1019
00:37:13,835 --> 00:37:16,636
- Get out of my office.
- I don't think so, James.

1020
00:37:16,671 --> 00:37:18,382
Because we may not have
had time to find proof,

1021
00:37:18,406 --> 00:37:20,106
but a reporter will.

1022
00:37:20,141 --> 00:37:21,819
Especially after we tell them
that you fired

1023
00:37:21,843 --> 00:37:23,421
an innocent woman
just because a potential donor

1024
00:37:23,445 --> 00:37:24,867
asked a few questions
about your books.

1025
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,146
When you put it that way,
it sounds like

1026
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:27,871
he did all this
to cover his guilty ass.

1027
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:28,838
Maybe we should give that
to the "Journal."

1028
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:30,906
That's a nice turn of phrase.

1029
00:37:30,942 --> 00:37:31,874
Thank you, Donna.

1030
00:37:31,909 --> 00:37:33,542
What do you want?

1031
00:37:33,578 --> 00:37:34,922
We want you to step down
and name

1032
00:37:34,946 --> 00:37:36,159
Peggy Davis
as your replacement.

1033
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,660
- You can't be serious.
- You don't want to find out

1034
00:37:38,695 --> 00:37:40,494
how serious we are, James.

1035
00:37:40,495 --> 00:37:42,595
Because you're looking
at two pissed-off women

1036
00:37:42,631 --> 00:37:45,398
who know exactly what you did
and how to prove it.

1037
00:37:48,537 --> 00:37:50,403
You'll have my resignation
by tonight.

1038
00:37:50,438 --> 00:37:52,138
Good.
And don't look at me like that.

1039
00:37:52,174 --> 00:37:53,606
If it wouldn't mean
your charity

1040
00:37:53,642 --> 00:37:55,253
would go out of business,
you'd be spending

1041
00:37:55,277 --> 00:37:57,577
the next five years in prison.

1042
00:38:07,088 --> 00:38:08,288
Hey.

1043
00:38:08,323 --> 00:38:10,023
Hey.

1044
00:38:10,058 --> 00:38:11,424
How'd it go?

1045
00:38:12,422 --> 00:38:14,160
We won.

1046
00:38:15,697 --> 00:38:17,096
Listen, about last night...

1047
00:38:17,132 --> 00:38:18,643
Brian, I didn't mean
to come off like...

1048
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:20,233
You didn't come off
like anything.

1049
00:38:20,268 --> 00:38:23,536
I just wanted to thank you
for not making me stay.

1050
00:38:23,572 --> 00:38:26,439
- But I thought you wanted...
- I know. I wanted to help.

1051
00:38:26,474 --> 00:38:29,642
But Julie and I,
we had a great time.

1052
00:38:29,678 --> 00:38:32,011
Austin slept through the night,
and we actually stayed up

1053
00:38:32,047 --> 00:38:33,580
and watched
"The Breakfast Club."

1054
00:38:33,615 --> 00:38:35,348
What's that?

1055
00:38:35,383 --> 00:38:40,587
Uh, just Julie and my
favorite movie of all time.

1056
00:38:40,622 --> 00:38:42,188
- I've never heard of it.
- Oh, my God.

1057
00:38:42,224 --> 00:38:43,334
You've never even heard of it?

1058
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:45,725
You have to see it.
I'm bringing you a copy.

1059
00:38:47,596 --> 00:38:49,329
Brian,
you don't have to do that.

1060
00:38:49,364 --> 00:38:51,297
I know I don't,
but that's what friends do.

1061
00:38:53,473 --> 00:38:54,439
Friends.

1062
00:38:54,474 --> 00:38:56,607
Yeah, friends.

1063
00:38:56,643 --> 00:38:58,109
That's what we said, right?

1064
00:38:58,144 --> 00:38:59,744
Yes, it is.

1065
00:38:59,779 --> 00:39:03,348
And thanks, I would love
to see it sometime.

1066
00:39:05,085 --> 00:39:06,451
Hey, you want to get
some lunch?

1067
00:39:06,486 --> 00:39:07,986
Sure.

1068
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:10,855
I mean, that's also
what friends do, right?

1069
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:13,858
Am I your first friend?

1070
00:39:16,096 --> 00:39:18,096
You know you're not.

1071
00:39:18,131 --> 00:39:20,431
Come on, let's go.

1072
00:39:23,556 --> 00:39:25,705
You get
that letter of resignation?

1073
00:39:25,706 --> 00:39:27,439
Right here.

1074
00:39:27,474 --> 00:39:30,408
And Peggy's job offer
is on its way.

1075
00:39:30,444 --> 00:39:33,245
- Look, Donna...
- Listen, Samantha...

1076
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,414
Let me go first this time.

1077
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:39,317
I was thinking
about how I don't trust people.

1078
00:39:39,353 --> 00:39:41,920
And I thought
maybe I should start.

1079
00:39:41,955 --> 00:39:43,922
And then I thought,

1080
00:39:43,957 --> 00:39:45,891
maybe I should start
by telling you

1081
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:49,794
why I cared so much about this
charity in the first place.

1082
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:53,498
Is this a rosé story
or a martini story?

1083
00:39:53,534 --> 00:39:55,233
Whiskey.

1084
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:57,736
How about tonight?

1085
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:58,637
That would be nice.

1086
00:39:58,672 --> 00:40:01,039
Meet you in the lobby
in half an hour?

1087
00:40:01,074 --> 00:40:02,307
You got it.

1088
00:40:02,342 --> 00:40:03,642
See you down there.

1089
00:40:08,335 --> 00:40:11,655
I'm glad I caught you in here
of all places.

1090
00:40:11,755 --> 00:40:13,255
Why's that?

1091
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,357
Because we have
a lot of history here.

1092
00:40:15,392 --> 00:40:16,670
And it seems
like the right place

1093
00:40:16,694 --> 00:40:18,560
for me to make things right.

1094
00:40:18,596 --> 00:40:19,806
You must have gone
to see Stan.

1095
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:23,532
I did.
Thank you for that.

1096
00:40:23,567 --> 00:40:27,336
Make things right.
Thanking me.

1097
00:40:27,371 --> 00:40:28,570
What went on in there?

1098
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:30,272
Among other things,

1099
00:40:30,307 --> 00:40:32,441
he helped me realize
I care about you;

1100
00:40:32,476 --> 00:40:34,409
I value you;

1101
00:40:34,445 --> 00:40:35,477
and I was afraid of...

1102
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:36,945
Losing me?

1103
00:40:36,981 --> 00:40:38,981
Which is why
you pushed me away.

1104
00:40:39,016 --> 00:40:40,182
Oh, my God.

1105
00:40:40,217 --> 00:40:41,950
You pulled a Litt.

1106
00:40:41,986 --> 00:40:43,251
Harvey, you became me.

1107
00:40:43,287 --> 00:40:44,431
Louis,
I wouldn't go that far.

1108
00:40:44,455 --> 00:40:47,789
Oh, no, you would.
And you did.

1109
00:40:47,825 --> 00:40:49,357
We are brothers
from another mother.

1110
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:51,615
And if you don't say that
right now,

1111
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:52,714
I'm gonna tell everyone
you're afraid of losing me.

1112
00:40:52,715 --> 00:40:53,664
- Louis.
- Right now.

1113
00:40:53,665 --> 00:40:55,230
Starting with Paul Porter.

1114
00:40:58,613 --> 00:41:00,313
We're brothers
from another mother.

1115
00:41:00,348 --> 00:41:02,159
I'm sorry, I couldn't...
could you repeat that?

1116
00:41:02,183 --> 00:41:03,549
- No, Louis, I couldn't.
- Why not?

1117
00:41:03,585 --> 00:41:05,418
Because I know
you're about to record it

1118
00:41:05,453 --> 00:41:07,153
on your Dictaphone.
And what if I am?

1119
00:41:07,188 --> 00:41:08,921
Because if you don't
say it again,

1120
00:41:08,957 --> 00:41:10,234
I'm gonna tell everyone
you're afraid of losing me.

1121
00:41:10,258 --> 00:41:11,858
And if you say that
one more time,

1122
00:41:11,893 --> 00:41:13,738
our friendship's over,
and I'm never looking back.

1123
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,172
Because I suffered
a momentary weakness,

1124
00:41:15,196 --> 00:41:17,296
but let's not forget
who's who in this situation.

1125
00:41:17,332 --> 00:41:18,765
I'll never mention it again.

1126
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,244
Now, put your hands
where I can see 'em.

1127
00:41:20,268 --> 00:41:21,868
- Why?
- Just do it.

1128
00:41:29,611 --> 00:41:31,767
What the hell
did you do that for?

1129
00:41:31,768 --> 00:41:34,169
Because, you and me
are going out tonight.

1130
00:41:34,204 --> 00:41:36,171
I'm gonna say
a lot of nice things to you,

1131
00:41:36,206 --> 00:41:38,006
and there isn't gonna be
any record of it.

1132
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:39,474
I can live with that.

1133
00:41:39,509 --> 00:41:41,576
Wait a minute.

1134
00:41:41,611 --> 00:41:44,312
How long did it take for you
to come to that with Stan?

1135
00:41:44,347 --> 00:41:46,548
- About 25 minutes, why?
- I don't believe it.

1136
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:49,025
You're even better at therapy
than I am.

1137
00:41:49,026 --> 00:41:50,592
Maybe I am.
But trust me.

1138
00:41:50,627 --> 00:41:52,766
Stan likes you better than me,
and he always will.

1139
00:41:52,767 --> 00:41:55,467
- You really think so?
- No, Louis, I don't.

1140
00:41:55,503 --> 00:41:56,335
Wait a minute.
Does this mean

1141
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,703
I get to have Joan back?

1142
00:41:58,806 --> 00:41:59,905
You sure can.

1143
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,307
And your first order
of business

1144
00:42:01,342 --> 00:42:02,908
is gonna be telling her
we filed suit

1145
00:42:02,943 --> 00:42:04,376
against a 16-year-old

1146
00:42:04,412 --> 00:42:06,245
that's gonna make her
look like shit.

1147
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,379
What?
You really did that?

1148
00:42:07,415 --> 00:42:08,580
What can I tell you, Louis?

1149
00:42:08,616 --> 00:42:11,483
The fear of losing you
makes a man do crazy things.

1150
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:12,562
Well, in that case,
after Sheila and I

1151
00:42:12,586 --> 00:42:13,764
are pregnant,
do you want to go mudding?

1152
00:42:13,788 --> 00:42:16,388
- No, Louis, I don't.
- Well, h...
