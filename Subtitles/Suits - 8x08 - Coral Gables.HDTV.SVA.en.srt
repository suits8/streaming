00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,110
<i>Previously on Suits</i>

2
00:00:01,485 --> 00:00:03,645
Gordon doesn't want a takeover.
He wants a deal

3
00:00:03,645 --> 00:00:06,315
where his guys come back,
they vote to merge with Zane,

4
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:08,405
- and we cease to exist.
- I found out

5
00:00:08,405 --> 00:00:10,775
my two partners,
Eric Kaldor and Ellen Rand,

6
00:00:10,775 --> 00:00:12,865
are willing to stab me in the back.

7
00:00:12,865 --> 00:00:15,155
We don't need
the sex phone anymore,

8
00:00:15,155 --> 00:00:16,615
because you hit the bull's eye.

9
00:00:16,615 --> 00:00:18,785
Oh, my God.
My boys can swim?

10
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,915
I've got a legal situation.
It's personal.

11
00:00:20,915 --> 00:00:22,795
You need me to send one
of ours your way.

12
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:25,715
- I was thinking Alex Williams.
- I guess firm harmony

13
00:00:25,715 --> 00:00:27,545
is why you want Alex
and not Samantha.

14
00:00:27,545 --> 00:00:29,755
That and a little of
the nature of the case.

15
00:00:29,755 --> 00:00:31,465
I got my period.
I'm not pregnant.

16
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,675
But the test said...
It was a false positive.

17
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:34,805
I'm so sorry.

18
00:00:40,605 --> 00:00:42,305
Samantha Wheeler.

19
00:00:42,305 --> 00:00:44,685
Normally I'm happy to see
a former colleague.

20
00:00:44,685 --> 00:00:47,695
Just not one that walked out
the door with half our business.

21
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:49,985
Then you're really
gonna hate it when I attack

22
00:00:49,985 --> 00:00:52,115
what little business
you have left.

23
00:00:55,825 --> 00:00:58,115
You're suing Grayscale.
I'm not.

24
00:00:58,115 --> 00:00:59,865
The federal government is.
Bullshit.

25
00:00:59,865 --> 00:01:01,745
You don't represent
the government.

26
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:04,955
If a company defrauds
the United States,

27
00:01:04,955 --> 00:01:07,255
any attorney can sue
to reclaim those damages.

28
00:01:07,255 --> 00:01:09,085
You can spout any Act you want.

29
00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:11,795
There's no way you give a shit
about the government.

30
00:01:11,795 --> 00:01:13,385
I don't.
But what I do care about

31
00:01:13,385 --> 00:01:15,885
is Grayscale coming over to us
like they wanted.

32
00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:17,515
They never wanted
to go with you.

33
00:01:17,515 --> 00:01:19,635
Why are you holding them
to their agreement?

34
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:21,555
And before you answer,
we both know

35
00:01:21,555 --> 00:01:24,475
it's because if you
let them go, they'd leave.

36
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:27,185
Well, they might have.
But now that you're suing them,

37
00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:29,235
you just tipped
the gray scales my way.

38
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:31,485
I forgot you and your puns.

39
00:01:31,485 --> 00:01:35,155
Well, I don't have to pretend
they're charming anymore.

40
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:37,655
So this is how it's gonna go.

41
00:01:37,655 --> 00:01:39,455
I'm gonna get you in a bear hug.

42
00:01:39,455 --> 00:01:42,245
Your only way out is
to let them come to us.

43
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:44,915
So you can do it now
or you can do it later,

44
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:47,295
but trust me, it's gonna happen.

45
00:01:47,295 --> 00:01:50,375
Thank you for stopping by,
Samantha.

46
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:53,135
I'd forgotten how much nicer
it is since you've been gone.

47
00:01:57,715 --> 00:02:00,225
Louis, what are
you still doing here?

48
00:02:00,225 --> 00:02:03,855
I took the day off.
And I called your office.

49
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:05,395
You're taking the day off too.

50
00:02:05,395 --> 00:02:06,815
But... No buts.

51
00:02:06,815 --> 00:02:09,355
I am taking you to
the happiest place on Earth.

52
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:13,775
Louis, as much as I love
Colonial Williamsburg,

53
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:15,065
I can't today.

54
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:16,825
Our costumes are already
in the car.

55
00:02:16,825 --> 00:02:18,235
I appreciate that, Louis.

56
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:20,825
And it's sweet
you wanna distract me

57
00:02:20,825 --> 00:02:23,075
from what happened.

58
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:26,585
But I was already planning on
taking today off, anyway.

59
00:02:26,585 --> 00:02:28,665
You were?
Yeah.

60
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:31,715
Louis, we had a false positive.

61
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:33,215
If we want a real positive,

62
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:35,795
we have to stop
leaving things to chance.

63
00:02:35,795 --> 00:02:38,305
So I made an appointment

64
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:41,225
with the top fertility
specialist in the country.

65
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:43,095
You really think
we need a specialist?

66
00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:44,975
I think these things
can take time.

67
00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:46,895
So the sooner we get some help,

68
00:02:46,895 --> 00:02:49,225
the sooner we can hold
that baby in our arms.

69
00:02:49,225 --> 00:02:50,565
What are we waiting for?

70
00:02:50,565 --> 00:02:53,445
You don't have to come.
Listen to me.

71
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:55,775
This is as important to me
as it is to you.

72
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,615
And there is nothing
on this earth

73
00:02:57,615 --> 00:02:59,735
that's gonna stop me
from being by your side.

74
00:03:04,995 --> 00:03:07,165
Samantha, can I talk to you
for a second?

75
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:08,665
I'm a little busy right now.

76
00:03:08,665 --> 00:03:10,545
What you mean is,
you're a little busy

77
00:03:10,545 --> 00:03:13,505
leveraging Eric Kaldor into
giving us one of his clients.

78
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:16,005
Yeah, that's what I said.
You think this is funny?

79
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:18,345
I think Robert has been
going through something.

80
00:03:18,345 --> 00:03:21,055
I wanna get him a little
present for when he gets back.

81
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:23,425
In other words, you heard
Robert and Alex bonded

82
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:25,345
over whatever he's been
going through,

83
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:27,645
you feel your chair
at the table's moving down,

84
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:29,265
and you're trying to move it up.

85
00:03:29,265 --> 00:03:30,725
So what if I am?

86
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:33,025
The present you get him
better be that client.

87
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:35,485
Eric Kaldor is no lightweight.

88
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:38,445
And last I checked, the cases
I take aren't your concern.

89
00:03:38,445 --> 00:03:39,985
They are
if there's a possibility

90
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:41,945
they could affect
this firm's record.

91
00:03:41,945 --> 00:03:44,285
So if you take this guy on,
you better win.

92
00:03:44,285 --> 00:03:46,785
That won't be a problem.
I know how Kaldor thinks.

93
00:03:46,785 --> 00:03:48,125
I'm sure you do.

94
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,085
But in this instance,
you picked a fight

95
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:52,915
with the one person
who wants to beat you more.

96
00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:55,005
I picked this fight.
I'm not backing down.

97
00:03:55,005 --> 00:03:57,835
Unless you wanna give me a
direct order I wouldn't follow,

98
00:03:57,835 --> 00:03:59,425
I suggest you get out of my way,

99
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:00,885
'cause I got a case to win.

100
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,335

101
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:43,135
There you are.

102
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,135
Gretchen,
where the hell is Louis?

103
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:47,515
You wanna try that again
with some civility?

104
00:04:47,515 --> 00:04:49,935
What? How about, "Good
morning, Gretchen.

105
00:04:49,935 --> 00:04:52,895
You look lovely today.
I brought you this fine latte."

106
00:04:52,895 --> 00:04:55,225
You're right. I'm coming up
against a deadline,

107
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:56,815
but that's no excuse to be rude.

108
00:04:56,815 --> 00:04:59,445
Good morning, Gretchen.
Don't you look lovely.

109
00:04:59,445 --> 00:05:02,325
Now didn't that feel better?
Actually, it did.

110
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:04,995
It will feel better
when you tell me where Louis is.

111
00:05:04,995 --> 00:05:06,615
I'm not so sure I will.

112
00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:08,865
Louis is gone for the day.
Shit.

113
00:05:08,865 --> 00:05:10,575
What's the problem?
White Mountain Water's

114
00:05:10,575 --> 00:05:12,835
putting together
a national distribution deal.

115
00:05:12,835 --> 00:05:15,625
We have to agree not to rep
any competition for a year.

116
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,125
You need Louis' approval
for a commitment like that.

117
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,425
He already agreed,
I just need his signature.

118
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:22,425
I need it by the end of the day.

119
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:25,845
Now it's my turn to say "shit".
Gretchen, I need that signature.

120
00:05:25,845 --> 00:05:27,675
And you will get it.
I'm saying "shit"

121
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:29,385
'cause I know
where I have to go.

122
00:05:29,385 --> 00:05:31,805
Gretchen.
Alex, just give me the document.

123
00:05:31,805 --> 00:05:33,645
Tell me where you need me
to send it.

124
00:05:33,645 --> 00:05:36,815
I give you my word,
it will get there.

125
00:05:37,815 --> 00:05:39,605
Hey.

126
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,195
Cucumber or eucalyptus?

127
00:05:42,195 --> 00:05:44,025
They have both?
They have everything.

128
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:46,865
See the waiting room? Leather
seats, soothing lighting...

129
00:05:46,865 --> 00:05:48,615
I haven't met him,
but I love him.

130
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:51,785
- Ms. Sazs. Mr. Litt.
- Dr. McManus.

131
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:54,165
Thank you for seeing us
on such short notice.

132
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:56,205
No "doctor" necessary.
I'm Charles,

133
00:05:56,205 --> 00:05:58,415
but everybody calls me... Chaz.

134
00:05:58,415 --> 00:05:59,965
Chaz McManus.

135
00:05:59,965 --> 00:06:02,335
That's right. Usually,
people guess Chuck. Heh.

136
00:06:02,335 --> 00:06:04,545
I have your files,
but I prefer to establish

137
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:06,595
baseline health myself.
Is that okay?

138
00:06:06,595 --> 00:06:08,515
Of course.
Uh, what do you need me to do?

139
00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:10,185
We'll start with blood samples.

140
00:06:10,185 --> 00:06:12,805
So just head down that hall.
The nurse will show you.

141
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,225
We can discuss
everything the two of you

142
00:06:15,225 --> 00:06:17,645
would like to accomplish.
Okay.

143
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:19,775
I'll see you in a bit.

144
00:06:19,775 --> 00:06:21,065
I'm sorry.

145
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:24,315
Do you not, uh...
remember me?

146
00:06:24,315 --> 00:06:27,275
I, uh...
Louis Litt.

147
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:29,865
Scarsdale High.
Class of '88?

148
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:31,745
I'm sorry,
I don't remember you, Louis.

149
00:06:31,745 --> 00:06:34,165
I never felt like I fit in
during high school.

150
00:06:34,165 --> 00:06:35,835
I don't think about those days.

151
00:06:35,835 --> 00:06:38,545
But I also know I wasn't
the nicest kid back then.

152
00:06:38,545 --> 00:06:40,585
If there's any bad blood
between us,

153
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:42,715
I hope there's no hard feelings.

154
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:49,805
So there she was,
feet in the stirrups,

155
00:06:49,805 --> 00:06:52,385
Louis looking, both of them
in hospital gowns...

156
00:06:52,385 --> 00:06:54,265
Wait, why was Louis in a gown?

157
00:06:54,265 --> 00:06:57,395
He didn't want her to feel self-conscious.
That's sweet.

158
00:06:57,395 --> 00:06:59,725
You get to say that
because you weren't there.

159
00:06:59,725 --> 00:07:01,185
I shouldn't have to remind you,

160
00:07:01,185 --> 00:07:03,855
those gowns don't close
in the behind.

161
00:07:03,855 --> 00:07:06,115
So between Louis and Sheila,

162
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:08,405
I had to walk that document in
like this:

163
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:10,785
Come on. Was she really
in the stirrups?

164
00:07:10,785 --> 00:07:13,405
I caught 'em
before they went in.

165
00:07:13,405 --> 00:07:15,825
That was the movie
that was playing in my head.

166
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:18,205
So as far as I'm concerned,
it's just as bad.

167
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:19,745
Well, the important thing is,

168
00:07:19,745 --> 00:07:22,715
Alex got his signature,
and the score remains

169
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:26,795
Gretchen: 1,000,973.
World: Zero.

170
00:07:26,795 --> 00:07:28,305
Damn right.

171
00:07:28,305 --> 00:07:30,305
Good luck with your stack, Red.

172
00:07:30,305 --> 00:07:31,595
You too, Gretchen.

173
00:07:31,595 --> 00:07:34,385
Oh. And whatever you do,

174
00:07:34,385 --> 00:07:37,225
try not to buy another ticket
to that movie.

175
00:07:39,355 --> 00:07:43,395
She just had to say that.

176
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:47,485
Mr. Kaldor, this trial is not
scheduled for another two weeks.

177
00:07:47,485 --> 00:07:49,775
You'd better have a good reason
for calling us.

178
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:51,235
I do. I would like you

179
00:07:51,235 --> 00:07:53,325
to remove Ms. Wheeler
from this case.

180
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:55,495
On what grounds?
On the grounds that you were

181
00:07:55,495 --> 00:07:57,535
an attorney of record
for my client.

182
00:07:57,535 --> 00:07:59,035
Is that true?
Absolutely not.

183
00:07:59,035 --> 00:08:00,875
I never worked on their case.

184
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:05,005
Well, according to this billing
sheet, uh, you absolutely did.

185
00:08:06,335 --> 00:08:08,795
This was seven years ago
for two hours.

186
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:10,505
Your Honor, I was an associate.

187
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:13,055
Someone must've told me
to run copies and bill it.

188
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,095
A minute ago,
you never worked for them.

189
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,435
Now it's running copies?

190
00:08:16,435 --> 00:08:18,395
Your Honor.
This is your billing sheet?

191
00:08:18,395 --> 00:08:22,185
I mean, this is your
signature, isn't it? Yes.

192
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:24,565
But even if I technically
worked for Grayscale,

193
00:08:24,565 --> 00:08:26,815
I never had access
to privileged information.

194
00:08:26,815 --> 00:08:28,775
Unless you're lying about
your billables,

195
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,365
a disbarrable offense.
Then, technically or not,

196
00:08:31,365 --> 00:08:32,905
you're bound by privilege.

197
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:35,325
Your Honor, she's prohibited
from bringing suit

198
00:08:35,325 --> 00:08:37,575
against an old client.

199
00:08:37,575 --> 00:08:39,875
I'm afraid he's right,
Ms. Wheeler.

200
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,955
Unless there's someone else
from your firm

201
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,795
not bound by privilege,
this case is dismissed.

202
00:08:48,755 --> 00:08:50,965
Louis. You
little piece of shit.

203
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:52,845
You ratted me out
for cheating in bio.

204
00:08:52,845 --> 00:08:55,135
You're right, I did.
Because it isn't fair,

205
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,805
Mr. O'Connor
grades on the curve.

206
00:08:56,805 --> 00:08:58,435
That sounded like talk-back.
Aah!

207
00:08:58,435 --> 00:09:00,805
Now, because of you,
O'Connor gave me an F,

208
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:03,515
and my old man is gonna kill me.
Know what that means?

209
00:09:03,515 --> 00:09:05,935
You're gonna do my homework
the rest of the year.

210
00:09:05,935 --> 00:09:07,945
You're not gonna say
a word about it.

211
00:09:07,945 --> 00:09:09,985
No, I'm not.
And you can't make me.

212
00:09:09,985 --> 00:09:12,575
Maybe you weren't listening.
I don't know bio.

213
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:14,865
Which means I don't know
where the kidneys are.

214
00:09:14,865 --> 00:09:16,115
Now, are they here?
Aah!

215
00:09:16,115 --> 00:09:17,075
Here?

216
00:09:17,075 --> 00:09:18,495
Or here?

217
00:09:18,495 --> 00:09:20,825
Still have
philosophical reservations?

218
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:24,045
Okay, I'll do it.
Just please, let me go.

219
00:09:24,045 --> 00:09:25,255
That's my boy.

220
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:27,215
Every day, before first bell,

221
00:09:27,215 --> 00:09:28,965
that day's homework
is in my hands.

222
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:31,005
You're ever late,
we're gonna take a trip

223
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:33,675
to the equipment locker
in front of the whole school,

224
00:09:33,675 --> 00:09:36,135
and I'm gonna lock you in.

225
00:09:43,685 --> 00:09:46,605
I spent the rest of the year
racing to school,

226
00:09:46,605 --> 00:09:48,985
just terrified I'd be late.

227
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:52,275
The first time I was,
Chaz was true to his word.

228
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:53,525
He dragged me to the gym,

229
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:56,195
shoved me into
an equipment locker,

230
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,995
and said that if I
ever told anyone,

231
00:09:57,995 --> 00:09:59,205
next time would be worse.

232
00:09:59,205 --> 00:10:01,415
You've told me
what a hard time you had

233
00:10:01,415 --> 00:10:03,665
in your youth, but this...

234
00:10:03,665 --> 00:10:06,585
That's not even the part
that I've been thinking about.

235
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:09,295
You see, by the end,

236
00:10:09,295 --> 00:10:11,505
I just stopped fighting.

237
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:14,255
So if I was late, Chaz would
walk me down the hall,

238
00:10:14,255 --> 00:10:15,545
we'd get to the gym,

239
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:18,385
he'd open up
the equipment locker door,

240
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:20,555
I'd hand him his homework,

241
00:10:20,555 --> 00:10:23,145
and I would walk myself
right in.

242
00:10:23,145 --> 00:10:25,895
I can only imagine
what you must have felt

243
00:10:25,895 --> 00:10:28,105
when you saw him again
after all this time.

244
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:31,645
All he had to say about it was,
"No hard feelings."

245
00:10:31,645 --> 00:10:33,235
Well, there are hard feelings.

246
00:10:33,235 --> 00:10:35,905
Feelings you have been carrying
with you ever since.

247
00:10:35,905 --> 00:10:38,235
That's why
I wanna show you this.

248
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:41,745
It's something that I haven't
looked at in 30 years.

249
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,255
Louis, what did Sheila say
when you showed her this?

250
00:10:51,255 --> 00:10:52,925
Show her?
No, I couldn't do that.

251
00:10:52,925 --> 00:10:54,425
Why not?

252
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:56,675
I've been doing research
since we left,

253
00:10:56,675 --> 00:10:58,135
hoping that it wasn't true.

254
00:10:58,135 --> 00:11:00,175
But there's nobody
better than this guy.

255
00:11:00,175 --> 00:11:03,055
If we want our best chances
to have this baby,

256
00:11:03,055 --> 00:11:06,555
I just have to deal with
these feelings.

257
00:11:06,555 --> 00:11:10,935
Then at least let Sheila in on
what you are going through.

258
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:12,815
Because if you don't
let off some steam,

259
00:11:12,815 --> 00:11:16,195
there is likely to be
an explosion.

260
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:26,285
Harvey? I'm sorry to bother you,
but do you have a minute?

261
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,995
Ha!
I don't believe this.

262
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:30,625
Shit went sideways with
your case, and you want help.

263
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,465
I didn't say that.
You didn't need to.

264
00:11:32,465 --> 00:11:35,545
You're here with your
pass-the-butter voice,

265
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:37,345
and I warned you
this would happen.

266
00:11:37,345 --> 00:11:38,965
Maybe you did, but...
Not "maybe".

267
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,555
I said you were picking
a fight with the wrong guy,

268
00:11:41,555 --> 00:11:43,885
and you said
you knew what you were doing.

269
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:45,225
Okay, Harvey.

270
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:46,895
You were right.

271
00:11:46,895 --> 00:11:49,775
Wanna say, "I told you so",
or wanna help me beat this guy?

272
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,275
You don't know what I wanna do.

273
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:54,025
I can't do that,
I guess I have to help you.

274
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:56,905
If what you're wanting to do
is take a swing at me,

275
00:11:56,905 --> 00:11:59,155
we can take this into the ring
once we're done.

276
00:11:59,155 --> 00:12:01,365
I meant, I wanna tape
your mouth shut.

277
00:12:01,365 --> 00:12:04,325
But I heard you talk a big game
with your boxing.

278
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:07,125
And trust me, you don't want
a piece of this.

279
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,125
I don't just box, Harvey,
I kickbox.

280
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,295
And my leg is 50 times stronger
than your arm.

281
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:13,415
Picking fights
outside your weight class

282
00:12:13,415 --> 00:12:15,795
is how you got into this mess
in the first place.

283
00:12:15,795 --> 00:12:18,715
You wanna figure out how
to get out of it, or you wanna

284
00:12:18,715 --> 00:12:21,175
make up fairy tales
about how you'd kick my ass?

285
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:23,265
I wanna figure out
how to get out of this.

286
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:24,885
We're gonna go upstairs
and order

287
00:12:24,885 --> 00:12:26,685
an extra-large pepperoni
and cheese.

288
00:12:26,685 --> 00:12:28,855
Because I might not
have picked this fight,

289
00:12:28,855 --> 00:12:33,185
but there is no way I am letting
Eric "I Need a Haircut" Kaldor

290
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,775
get the better
of one of my people.

291
00:12:39,735 --> 00:12:40,905
Hey.

292
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:44,655
Oh, what is this for?

293
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:49,335
For being by my side today.

294
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,495
Of course.
I told you that I would be.

295
00:12:51,495 --> 00:12:53,045
Well, it really set me at ease.

296
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:57,125
And I have to say,
Chaz is so knowledgeable,

297
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,755
and his bedside manner
is a dream.

298
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:02,215
Right. He's the best.

299
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:05,135
We're gonna be swimming
in babies by the time

300
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:06,385
he's through with us.

301
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,265
Louis, what's wrong?

302
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,855
Chaz was my bully
in high school.

303
00:13:11,855 --> 00:13:15,145
He tortured me
my entire junior year.

304
00:13:15,145 --> 00:13:18,155
That's awful. Why didn't you
say something to me?

305
00:13:18,155 --> 00:13:19,565
It was 30 years ago.

306
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,735
I'm not gonna let
something from high school

307
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:23,735
keep us from seeing
the best specialist.

308
00:13:23,735 --> 00:13:25,535
We can find
whoever's second best.

309
00:13:25,535 --> 00:13:27,455
No, we can't.
If it didn't work out,

310
00:13:27,455 --> 00:13:29,205
I would never forgive myself.

311
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:31,125
I can handle it.

312
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:35,125
Are you sure?
Trust me, I'll be okay.

313
00:13:36,835 --> 00:13:40,215
Carla, I got your message.
I came as soon as I could.

314
00:13:40,215 --> 00:13:43,055
You need to use that retainer
we pay to buy a faster car.

315
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,555
I found out we no longer have
a distribution deal.

316
00:13:45,555 --> 00:13:47,595
What are you talking about?
Our distributor

317
00:13:47,595 --> 00:13:48,975
you said we had a deal with

318
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:50,895
called to say
they got a better offer.

319
00:13:50,895 --> 00:13:53,565
If they have a competing offer
that fast, they've been

320
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:56,065
negotiating in bad faith.
I don't give a shit.

321
00:13:56,065 --> 00:13:58,275
I wanna know
what you're gonna do about it.

322
00:13:58,275 --> 00:14:00,105
The only way
they can break our deal

323
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,945
is if that signature
didn't get there.

324
00:14:01,945 --> 00:14:04,115
If they try to back out...
Don't you get it?

325
00:14:04,115 --> 00:14:05,655
There is no other reason.

326
00:14:05,655 --> 00:14:08,825
They're saying that signature
never got there.

327
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:11,325
Carla, I'm telling you,
that signature got there,

328
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:13,285
and they're not backing out
of anything.

329
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,995
You'd better be right.

330
00:14:14,995 --> 00:14:17,835
Because our future
is based on this expansion.

331
00:14:17,835 --> 00:14:21,885
And like I said,
you told me it was a done deal.

332
00:14:27,265 --> 00:14:30,515
Tell me you sent
Louis' signature over today.

333
00:14:30,515 --> 00:14:31,895
I did. Why?

334
00:14:31,895 --> 00:14:33,645
They're saying
they never got it.

335
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:35,065
That's some grade A bullshit.

336
00:14:35,065 --> 00:14:37,185
The courier came and took it
this afternoon.

337
00:14:37,185 --> 00:14:38,935
The courier failed to deliver...

338
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:40,945
Or these guys
are straight up lying.

339
00:14:40,945 --> 00:14:43,155
I need you to get me a receipt.

340
00:14:43,155 --> 00:14:45,735
Then you'll have it by tomorrow.
Don't worry.

341
00:14:45,735 --> 00:14:46,785
We'll fix this.

342
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:47,985
Thanks, Gretchen.

343
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:50,285
I appreciate you
being all over this.

344
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:54,745
Hold on.

345
00:14:54,745 --> 00:14:58,205
If we can prove you never had
any contact with Grayscale,

346
00:14:58,205 --> 00:15:01,165
we can argue no privilege
relationship existed.

347
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:02,545
It's an idea.

348
00:15:02,545 --> 00:15:04,755
Even if we subpoena
everybody from back then,

349
00:15:04,755 --> 00:15:06,845
it's not in their interest
to clear me.

350
00:15:06,845 --> 00:15:09,595
Plus, Kaldor could
still say it doesn't matter

351
00:15:09,595 --> 00:15:11,725
because you saw
confidential information.

352
00:15:11,725 --> 00:15:13,555
Goddamn that man.

353
00:15:13,555 --> 00:15:16,315
All I wanted was to get Robert
another client.

354
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:20,145
No, you're a saint and all you
were doing was God's work.

355
00:15:20,145 --> 00:15:22,105
All right,
you don't have to rub it in.

356
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:24,855
I do if we're gonna have
any fun tonight.

357
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:26,275
Speaking of fun...

358
00:15:26,275 --> 00:15:28,485
It's late,
we just shared a pizza,

359
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:30,785
I have to ask:
What is it with you and Robert?

360
00:15:30,785 --> 00:15:33,115
I'm not talking about
me and Robert with you.

361
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:35,455
You can tell Donna,
but you can't tell me?

362
00:15:35,455 --> 00:15:37,375
You know we went out?
Of course I do.

363
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,995
I know everything.

364
00:15:38,995 --> 00:15:41,005
Even the time
that you tried to...

365
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:42,375
No. You don't know anything.

366
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,505
You're trying to get me
to spill the beans

367
00:15:44,505 --> 00:15:46,885
because Donna wouldn't.
So what if I am?

368
00:15:46,885 --> 00:15:48,885
Hmm. That's exactly
what I said to you

369
00:15:48,885 --> 00:15:51,635
when you called me out
on doing this because of Alex.

370
00:15:51,635 --> 00:15:53,385
So what if I am?

371
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,935
Maybe we're more alike
than you thought, after all.

372
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:58,685
That's what you tried telling me
when you first got here

373
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:00,645
when you flipped me the bird.

374
00:16:00,645 --> 00:16:02,565
As I recall,
you flipped it right back.

375
00:16:02,565 --> 00:16:04,735
Yeah, well,
maybe we really are...

376
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:07,405
Wait a second.
More alike than we thought.

377
00:16:07,405 --> 00:16:09,025
What if it's
not just you and me?

378
00:16:09,025 --> 00:16:10,785
What have you got?
Kaldor.

379
00:16:10,785 --> 00:16:12,745
He said the only way I could
get around the billing sheet

380
00:16:12,745 --> 00:16:14,535
was to say I'd lied about it.

381
00:16:14,535 --> 00:16:17,415
What if he's the one who lied,
and that sheet never existed?

382
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:20,165
Looks like someone needs to pay
a visit to Eric Kaldor.

383
00:16:20,165 --> 00:16:22,415
You think you can handle it?

384
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:25,295
Why would I handle it?
Because...

385
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:28,465
You helped me
when you didn't have to,

386
00:16:28,465 --> 00:16:30,755
and you just said
you wanted to have some fun.

387
00:16:30,755 --> 00:16:32,305
What better way to have some fun

388
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:34,345
than sticking it to Eric Kaldor?
I get it.

389
00:16:34,345 --> 00:16:36,765
You don't just wanna get
Robert a present.

390
00:16:36,765 --> 00:16:40,645
You wanna get me personally
invested in your success.

391
00:16:40,645 --> 00:16:42,315
So what if I do?

392
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:44,485
Okay, Samantha,
I'll take care of Eric.

393
00:16:44,485 --> 00:16:46,315
But before we call it a night,

394
00:16:46,315 --> 00:16:49,655
this idea came from you
suggesting you're like him.

395
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:52,745
And then, you started talking
about fabricating evidence.

396
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,575
The answer is no, Harvey.

397
00:16:54,575 --> 00:16:57,825
I've never fabricated evidence
in my life.

398
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:01,955
Hi. I need a receipt
for a package

399
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:03,205
I sent with your service.

400
00:17:03,205 --> 00:17:04,955
Of course.
What's your order number?

401
00:17:04,955 --> 00:17:07,375
One-two-six-five-seven.

402
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:11,465
Our records show
that package was never sent.

403
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:13,715
Your records are wrong.
I sent it.

404
00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:15,885
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.

405
00:17:15,885 --> 00:17:18,265
Don't say anything.
Put me through to the courier.

406
00:17:18,265 --> 00:17:21,355
If there's no record, talking
to him isn't gonna help.

407
00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:24,225
Our couriers are extremely busy,
and I don't have time to...

408
00:17:24,225 --> 00:17:27,195
Listen here, young lady.
You don't think I'm busy? I am.

409
00:17:27,195 --> 00:17:29,315
But not too busy
to find out where you live,

410
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,985
your mother's maiden name,
and anything else it takes

411
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:34,985
to make your life a living hell
if you don't put me through

412
00:17:34,985 --> 00:17:36,455
to that goddamn courier.

413
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,165
I'll see if I can connect him.

414
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:44,585
- Hello?
- Leroy.

415
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:47,005
Thank God, it's you.
Yep. It's me, all right.

416
00:17:47,005 --> 00:17:49,125
I understand there is a problem.

417
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,175
There sure is.

418
00:17:50,175 --> 00:17:51,465
I left a package for you

419
00:17:51,465 --> 00:17:52,845
this afternoon on my desk.

420
00:17:52,845 --> 00:17:54,965
I know you picked it up
because it's gone.

421
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:57,055
Sorry, Gretchen.
It wasn't there.

422
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:59,015
I waited around, like,
for 10 minutes.

423
00:17:59,015 --> 00:18:01,855
I asked the receptionist.
She didn't have it, so I left.

424
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:06,185
Oh. Thank you, then, Leroy.

425
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,525
Thank... Thanks for your time.

426
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:10,025
Sorry to put you out.
No problem.

427
00:18:37,135 --> 00:18:38,725
Shit.

428
00:18:41,055 --> 00:18:43,725
Hello.
You must be Missy.

429
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:46,025
That's right.
And you are?

430
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,685
A friend of Sandy McClusky's.

431
00:18:47,685 --> 00:18:49,565
The woman who used to
cover this desk?

432
00:18:49,565 --> 00:18:51,655
I remember Sandy.
She trained me.

433
00:18:51,655 --> 00:18:53,405
Well, tried to, anyway.

434
00:18:53,405 --> 00:18:57,195
Sandy and I came up together
in the pool at Johnson Powell,

435
00:18:57,195 --> 00:18:59,155
along with Rebecca Hart
and Pat Nichols.

436
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:00,615
We went through a lot together.

437
00:19:00,615 --> 00:19:02,705
How does that have
anything to do with me?

438
00:19:02,705 --> 00:19:04,785
Sandy owed me a favor
before she retired,

439
00:19:04,785 --> 00:19:06,205
and I need to call it in.

440
00:19:06,205 --> 00:19:08,625
So call her.
Well, she's in Coral Gables.

441
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,545
You're the one on this desk now,
so the favor falls to you.

442
00:19:11,545 --> 00:19:14,965
I need you to log that you
received this yesterday.

443
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:21,555
The problem with that is
I didn't receive it yesterday.

444
00:19:21,555 --> 00:19:24,395
It was an honest mistake.
Honest or not, it's yours.

445
00:19:24,395 --> 00:19:25,765
Why should I cover for you?

446
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,145
Because Sandy owed me.

447
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:29,065
That's how we
take care of each other.

448
00:19:29,065 --> 00:19:31,275
It's been going on
since before you were born.

449
00:19:31,275 --> 00:19:34,445
And your chance to cash in that
favor walked out when she did.

450
00:19:34,445 --> 00:19:36,865
Listen to me, young lady.
No, you listen to me.

451
00:19:36,865 --> 00:19:38,905
You're asking me
to lie to my boss,

452
00:19:38,905 --> 00:19:41,955
and I'm not gonna do it.
So instead of coming in here

453
00:19:41,955 --> 00:19:43,995
trying to get me
to put my ass on the line

454
00:19:43,995 --> 00:19:46,245
to honor
some 80-year-old tradition,

455
00:19:46,245 --> 00:19:49,125
why don't you not screw up
in the first place?

456
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:52,425
You think you're hot shit,
and you don't need anyone.

457
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:55,345
Well, one day, you're gonna be
in the position that I'm in,

458
00:19:55,345 --> 00:19:57,755
and you're gonna wish
like hell you had a network

459
00:19:57,755 --> 00:20:00,225
of people to call on for help.
Maybe I will.

460
00:20:00,225 --> 00:20:04,685
But something tells me by then,
you'll be long gone.

461
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,945
Harvey Specter.

462
00:20:18,945 --> 00:20:20,655
Don't tell me.

463
00:20:20,655 --> 00:20:23,455
You're picking up the case
I had Samantha booted off of,

464
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,875
and now I'm supposed to be
shaking with fear.

465
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,625
You think I'd let you off
that easy, Eric? Not a chance.

466
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,665
What?
There's an old saying.

467
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:33,165
Accuse the other side
of that which you are guilty.

468
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,045
Another old saying:
Get to the point.

469
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:37,465
You said Samantha lied
about that billing sheet.

470
00:20:37,465 --> 00:20:40,005
Which got us thinking,
you lied about that sheet.

471
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,805
Samantha never worked
for Grayscale.

472
00:20:41,805 --> 00:20:45,055
You say that again, and I will
have you sued for slander.

473
00:20:45,055 --> 00:20:46,765
I won't say it.
I'll just prove it.

474
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:49,145
You gonna get me to admit
something I never did?

475
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:52,065
No, Eric. I'll subpoena
every bill ever sent

476
00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:54,945
and every billing sheet
ever submitted by Samantha.

477
00:20:54,945 --> 00:20:58,025
When they don't add up, we won't
need this case to move forward

478
00:20:58,025 --> 00:21:01,445
because you'll be disbarred
for fabricated evidence.

479
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:03,195
There's no way
I have to hand over

480
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,415
proprietary records
to a competing firm.

481
00:21:05,415 --> 00:21:09,035
You really wanna take
that chance over one client?

482
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:12,455
Let this go, Eric.
It's over.

483
00:21:12,455 --> 00:21:15,675
So it's not enough you had
to take my partner

484
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:18,545
and half my business?
You have to come after the rest?

485
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:20,305
I didn't come after anything.

486
00:21:20,305 --> 00:21:22,925
But as long as we're talking,

487
00:21:22,925 --> 00:21:25,885
I didn't take your partner.
You went behind his back

488
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,845
to try to steal both our firms.

489
00:21:27,845 --> 00:21:30,515
If you think this little
sob story's gonna move me,

490
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:33,065
you might as well pick up
a tissue, dab your eyes,

491
00:21:33,065 --> 00:21:34,565
and tell it somewhere else.

492
00:21:34,565 --> 00:21:36,985
And when you're finished,
you can call Grayscale

493
00:21:36,985 --> 00:21:39,695
and let them know
they're now represented by me.

494
00:21:48,535 --> 00:21:49,955
Gretchen.

495
00:21:49,955 --> 00:21:51,495
What brings you to my office?

496
00:21:51,495 --> 00:21:53,625
I need help.
Let me guess.

497
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,165
You're coming to me because
you heard I fix things.

498
00:21:56,165 --> 00:21:58,755
I'm coming because
when Louis lost his mind on you,

499
00:21:58,755 --> 00:22:00,385
you didn't run to Robert.

500
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:03,095
You went to Harvey because
you knew he needed a friend.

501
00:22:03,095 --> 00:22:05,425
And right now,
you need a friend.

502
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:08,595
I screwed up big-time.

503
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:11,475
Didn't send a document
that needed to be sent,

504
00:22:11,475 --> 00:22:14,185
and now Alex Williams
is gonna be in deep shit.

505
00:22:14,185 --> 00:22:15,985
Gretchen, I may be good,
but I can't

506
00:22:15,985 --> 00:22:18,735
travel back in time for you.
I know that.

507
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:21,945
I asked that goddamn secretary
to cover for me,

508
00:22:21,945 --> 00:22:23,775
but she wouldn't honor the code.

509
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,495
So you want me
to make it look like

510
00:22:25,495 --> 00:22:27,205
it's her fault and not yours.

511
00:22:27,205 --> 00:22:29,035
That's right.

512
00:22:30,205 --> 00:22:32,995
I'm sorry.
I... I can't do it.

513
00:22:32,995 --> 00:22:35,205
Is this because I told you
it could hurt Alex?

514
00:22:35,205 --> 00:22:36,955
This has nothing to do
with Alex.

515
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:39,585
I'm telling you this
because what it would take

516
00:22:39,585 --> 00:22:42,845
to fix this thing could make it
a thousand times worse.

517
00:22:42,845 --> 00:22:46,055
And being your friend means
telling you it is not worth it.

518
00:22:46,055 --> 00:22:47,515
But Samantha...
No buts.

519
00:22:47,515 --> 00:22:49,765
You need to go to Alex
and tell him the truth.

520
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:52,355
Because this is his client,
and he deserves to know.

521
00:22:58,275 --> 00:23:01,195
Louis, what are you doing?
You're missing dinner.

522
00:23:01,195 --> 00:23:03,655
It's sloppy joe night.
I'm not missing anything.

523
00:23:03,655 --> 00:23:05,285
I'm writing a contract.

524
00:23:05,285 --> 00:23:07,745
What? Is that your Civics
homework or something?

525
00:23:07,745 --> 00:23:09,995
No, Esther. It's
a legally binding document,

526
00:23:09,995 --> 00:23:12,535
stipulating that I'm required
to get even with Chaz

527
00:23:12,535 --> 00:23:14,495
by the end of the school year.

528
00:23:14,495 --> 00:23:16,625
Because he's putting you
in the locker.

529
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,205
Yes, Esther, that's what I mean.

530
00:23:18,205 --> 00:23:20,675
Trust me, Louis.

531
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:22,465
Whatever you're
thinking of doing,

532
00:23:22,465 --> 00:23:24,885
Chaz is just gonna
make your life worse.

533
00:23:24,885 --> 00:23:26,965
Like you know about
dealing with a bully.

534
00:23:26,965 --> 00:23:28,425
Believe me, I do.

535
00:23:28,425 --> 00:23:31,015
Remember when I dropped out
of band last year?

536
00:23:31,015 --> 00:23:32,895
When you told Mom
you couldn't stand

537
00:23:32,895 --> 00:23:34,145
being associated with me?

538
00:23:34,145 --> 00:23:35,975
What I couldn't stand

539
00:23:35,975 --> 00:23:38,485
was Carolyn Price
picking on me every day.

540
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:40,025
I didn't know that.

541
00:23:40,025 --> 00:23:41,775
Well, now you do.

542
00:23:41,775 --> 00:23:43,695
So do you want my advice or not?

543
00:23:44,775 --> 00:23:46,325
I want it.

544
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:48,575
Lay low, do what he wants,

545
00:23:48,575 --> 00:23:50,655
and hope he forgets
you ever existed.

546
00:23:50,655 --> 00:23:52,705
He's not going to forget,
and neither am I.

547
00:23:52,705 --> 00:23:54,375
Louis, don't you get it?

548
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:57,335
Guys like Chaz always
get their way in high school.

549
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,545
But high school ends.
And before you know it,

550
00:23:59,545 --> 00:24:02,255
you'll be successful,
and he'll be pumping your gas.

551
00:24:02,255 --> 00:24:04,755
Oh, my God, you're right.

552
00:24:04,755 --> 00:24:06,965
I'm not powerful enough
to face him now.

553
00:24:06,965 --> 00:24:08,305
But some day, I'll show him.

554
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:10,015
No, Louis,
that's not what I meant.

555
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,685
Now, excuse me. I need
to read over my contract.

556
00:24:19,775 --> 00:24:21,735
Carla, let me
call you right back.

557
00:24:21,735 --> 00:24:24,735
I think what we needed
just walked into my office.

558
00:24:24,735 --> 00:24:26,365
She still pissed?

559
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:28,535
She won't be, once you
hand over that receipt.

560
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:31,325
That's just it, Alex.
There isn't one.

561
00:24:31,325 --> 00:24:34,165
Come again? I never sent
the documents over.

562
00:24:34,165 --> 00:24:36,835
Are you shitting me? You're
coming to me with this now?

563
00:24:36,835 --> 00:24:38,875
I just realized last night
what happened.

564
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:40,625
Why didn't you come
to me last night?

565
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:41,955
I thought I could fix it.

566
00:24:41,955 --> 00:24:43,415
No, no.
Let's just review.

567
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,755
After you gave me
bullshit about "Good morning.

568
00:24:45,755 --> 00:24:47,545
You look lovely,"
you lied to my face.

569
00:24:47,545 --> 00:24:50,515
It wasn't a lie. When I
found out, I tried to fix it.

570
00:24:50,515 --> 00:24:54,055
Well, you didn't. When Carla
finds out this was on me...

571
00:24:54,055 --> 00:24:57,185
It's my fault.
I'll take the bullet.

572
00:24:57,185 --> 00:24:58,895
Take the bullet?

573
00:24:58,895 --> 00:25:01,355
They're not gonna give a shit
whose fault this is.

574
00:25:01,355 --> 00:25:03,065
It's my client.
It's on my head.

575
00:25:03,065 --> 00:25:04,645
Is there anything I can do?

576
00:25:04,645 --> 00:25:07,155
Yeah. From now on, do what
you say you're gonna do.

577
00:25:07,155 --> 00:25:08,945
And if for some reason
you don't,

578
00:25:08,945 --> 00:25:11,695
at least have the courage to
tell me before it's too late.

579
00:25:17,205 --> 00:25:18,745
I know we demanded the client,

580
00:25:18,745 --> 00:25:20,995
but I never imagined
you'd hand-deliver them.

581
00:25:20,995 --> 00:25:23,795
The only thing I'm delivering,
Samantha, is an ultimatum.

582
00:25:23,795 --> 00:25:26,505
The thing about giving
ultimatums, Eric,

583
00:25:26,505 --> 00:25:28,385
is that you need to have
the upper hand.

584
00:25:28,385 --> 00:25:29,925
You don't.
I thought that too.

585
00:25:29,925 --> 00:25:31,845
Then I thought about
what Harvey said.

586
00:25:31,845 --> 00:25:34,675
Accuse the other side
of that which you are guilty.

587
00:25:34,675 --> 00:25:37,725
And I think
that's what you did to me.

588
00:25:37,725 --> 00:25:39,395
Sorry to disappoint you,

589
00:25:39,395 --> 00:25:41,855
but I have never fabricated
any evidence.

590
00:25:41,855 --> 00:25:44,485
No, but you buried some.
Corman Ventures.

591
00:25:44,485 --> 00:25:46,065
That was just a personal case

592
00:25:46,065 --> 00:25:47,775
I took care of
as a favor to Robert.

593
00:25:47,775 --> 00:25:49,565
I think you broke the law
to do it.

594
00:25:49,565 --> 00:25:51,575
You don't know what
you're talking about.

595
00:25:51,575 --> 00:25:53,325
Maybe not.
But Betty Palmer does.

596
00:25:54,325 --> 00:25:55,705
See, it always bothered me,

597
00:25:55,705 --> 00:25:57,535
the circumstances
around her leaving.

598
00:25:57,535 --> 00:25:59,665
So I decided to give her a call.
Bullshit.

599
00:25:59,665 --> 00:26:01,415
There's no way
she talked to you.

600
00:26:01,415 --> 00:26:04,045
Why don't you stroll down
to Coral Gables to find out?

601
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:06,165
When you're finished,
if you don't want her

602
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:08,045
telling the world
what she told me,

603
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:10,045
you'll hand over
your oldest client.

604
00:26:10,045 --> 00:26:13,425
I'm not gonna just hand over
my oldest client to you.

605
00:26:13,425 --> 00:26:14,925
Well, I think you will.

606
00:26:14,925 --> 00:26:16,935
Because you put me
in front of a judge...

607
00:26:16,935 --> 00:26:19,475
"Your Honor, I didn't
fabricate anything.

608
00:26:19,475 --> 00:26:21,475
Someone must have made
a clerical error."

609
00:26:21,475 --> 00:26:23,395
She has got you dead to rights.

610
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:26,355
No. It's her word
against mine.

611
00:26:26,355 --> 00:26:29,445
Well... Like Harvey said,
you know, you really wanna

612
00:26:29,445 --> 00:26:32,115
take that chance over
one piece of business?

613
00:26:32,115 --> 00:26:35,825
I'll expect my new client's
information by tomorrow.

614
00:26:44,095 --> 00:26:46,685
How are you doing, Louis?

615
00:26:46,685 --> 00:26:48,645
A little nervous.
You?

616
00:26:49,765 --> 00:26:52,025
A little nervous.

617
00:26:52,025 --> 00:26:53,985
Sheila. Louis.
Thank you for coming in.

618
00:26:53,985 --> 00:26:56,525
We're surprised you asked us
to come back so soon.

619
00:26:56,525 --> 00:26:58,445
Well, I didn't wanna
concern you, but...

620
00:26:58,445 --> 00:27:01,235
Oh, God. Is there something
wrong with my test results?

621
00:27:01,235 --> 00:27:02,695
It's nothing we can't handle.

622
00:27:02,695 --> 00:27:03,955
You have cervical fibroids

623
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,825
that, unfortunately,
your OB missed.

624
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:07,665
And I'd like to remove them.

625
00:27:07,665 --> 00:27:09,745
You... You mean like surgery?

626
00:27:09,745 --> 00:27:12,505
It's just a simple outpatient
laparoscopic procedure.

627
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,965
I've done it hundreds of times.

628
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,295
Okay, then,
I think we should do it.

629
00:27:16,295 --> 00:27:18,585
I'll set something up
in the next two weeks...

630
00:27:18,585 --> 00:27:19,845
Hold on a minute.

631
00:27:19,845 --> 00:27:21,715
Maybe we should get
a second opinion.

632
00:27:21,715 --> 00:27:23,635
You're welcome to get
a second opinion.

633
00:27:23,635 --> 00:27:25,885
But I think we should
schedule the surgery now.

634
00:27:25,885 --> 00:27:27,685
That way, we have it
on the books.

635
00:27:27,685 --> 00:27:30,395
For the record, this is my area
of expertise. I think that...

636
00:27:30,395 --> 00:27:32,185
If you know
what's good for you,

637
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:34,185
you'll get in that locker.

638
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:36,565
Litt, I could punch you
before you get in

639
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:38,565
or you could just get in.

640
00:27:39,815 --> 00:27:41,325
Aren't you forgetting something?

641
00:27:55,505 --> 00:27:57,965
Well, Louis, what do you think
of that plan?

642
00:27:57,965 --> 00:28:00,595
I don't give a shit
what your area of expertise is.

643
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,465
We're not gonna schedule
a goddamn thing

644
00:28:02,465 --> 00:28:05,595
with you now or ever.
And if you lay one hand

645
00:28:05,595 --> 00:28:07,435
on the woman I love,
I swear to God,

646
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,095
I'll beat the shit out of you.

647
00:28:11,895 --> 00:28:14,395
Well, Louis...

648
00:28:14,395 --> 00:28:17,395
what do you think of that plan?

649
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:20,485
I see no reason why
we need a second opinion.

650
00:28:20,485 --> 00:28:21,775
We'll do whatever you say.

651
00:28:21,775 --> 00:28:23,905
Great, then,
it's all settled.

652
00:28:29,665 --> 00:28:30,995
Hey, Samantha.

653
00:28:30,995 --> 00:28:33,165
Donna, whatever it is,
I'm kind of busy.

654
00:28:33,165 --> 00:28:35,335
I can see that.
Does it have to do

655
00:28:35,335 --> 00:28:38,335
with why you pushed three client
meetings at the last minute?

656
00:28:38,335 --> 00:28:40,585
I didn't realize you kept
tabs on my calendar.

657
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,215
I don't.

658
00:28:42,215 --> 00:28:44,675
When those clients get
brushed off by their lawyer,

659
00:28:44,675 --> 00:28:46,425
I'm the one they call.
I told them

660
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:47,845
those meetings will be back

661
00:28:47,845 --> 00:28:49,595
as soon as I'm back
from my trip.

662
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:52,395
What trip? You haven't
submitted a travel request.

663
00:28:52,395 --> 00:28:55,225
And I won't be,
because this is personal.

664
00:28:55,225 --> 00:28:58,565
Okay, does this have to do with
Eric Kaldor coming here today?

665
00:28:58,565 --> 00:29:01,105
It has to do with me
needing to get down to Florida

666
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:03,195
and you not telling anyone.
Samantha.

667
00:29:03,195 --> 00:29:05,075
Donna, just let me do what I do.

668
00:29:05,075 --> 00:29:06,735
Let me get this straight.

669
00:29:06,735 --> 00:29:09,035
You want me to keep something
from Harvey and Robert

670
00:29:09,035 --> 00:29:10,665
that might blow up
in their faces

671
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,165
without telling me what it is?

672
00:29:12,165 --> 00:29:13,575
Yes. I do.

673
00:29:13,575 --> 00:29:14,995
I'm not sure I can do that.

674
00:29:14,995 --> 00:29:16,295
You know what, Donna?

675
00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:18,125
You wanna tell someone,
go ahead.

676
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:20,505
Doesn't matter, 'cause
I'm getting on that plane.

677
00:29:20,505 --> 00:29:22,925
Okay, go ahead
and catch your plane.

678
00:29:22,925 --> 00:29:25,755
I just hope you know
what you're doing.

679
00:29:31,805 --> 00:29:34,765
Whatever you're up
to, it's not gonna happen.

680
00:29:34,765 --> 00:29:36,725
'Cause you're not getting
on that plane.

681
00:29:36,725 --> 00:29:38,985
Donna told you.
Damn right, Donna told me.

682
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,355
I don't believe it.
She led me to think that I...

683
00:29:41,355 --> 00:29:43,945
When I asked you
if you fabricated evidence,

684
00:29:43,945 --> 00:29:45,905
you said you hadn't,
and I believed you.

685
00:29:45,905 --> 00:29:47,865
But now I think you have.
Harvey.

686
00:29:47,865 --> 00:29:49,535
I think you fabricated evidence,

687
00:29:49,535 --> 00:29:51,245
Kaldor is using it
to blackmail you,

688
00:29:51,245 --> 00:29:52,615
and you're about to head to

689
00:29:52,615 --> 00:29:54,245
wherever you're going
to stop it.

690
00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:56,585
Are you finished?
Am I right?

691
00:29:56,585 --> 00:29:57,995
I didn't lie to you.

692
00:29:57,995 --> 00:29:59,795
And I never fabricated evidence.

693
00:29:59,795 --> 00:30:01,915
What the hell's going on here?

694
00:30:03,755 --> 00:30:07,805
Five years ago,
we had a case. Criminal.

695
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:09,555
One of our CEO's adult children

696
00:30:09,555 --> 00:30:11,515
was charged
with attempted murder.

697
00:30:11,515 --> 00:30:13,935
The pharmaceutical guy's daughter.
That's the one.

698
00:30:13,935 --> 00:30:17,435
And I did what it took
to get her out of it.

699
00:30:17,435 --> 00:30:19,065
And what exactly did it take?

700
00:30:19,065 --> 00:30:21,275
I buried evidence.

701
00:30:21,275 --> 00:30:22,945
I can't believe...
Before you say...

702
00:30:22,945 --> 00:30:24,405
You let a guilty woman off.

703
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,405
She wasn't guilty,
and I know it.

704
00:30:26,405 --> 00:30:29,235
That's exactly what
my old mentor sounded like

705
00:30:29,235 --> 00:30:31,655
when it ended up
that he put away a man

706
00:30:31,655 --> 00:30:34,115
for a murder he didn't commit.
Well, I'm not him.

707
00:30:34,115 --> 00:30:36,705
I'm not gonna apologize
for doing what I had to.

708
00:30:36,705 --> 00:30:38,585
I don't give a shit
if you apologize.

709
00:30:38,585 --> 00:30:40,545
We're gonna fix this.
Damn right, we are.

710
00:30:40,545 --> 00:30:43,005
We're gonna fix it
by putting Betty Palmer on ice.

711
00:30:43,005 --> 00:30:44,375
Who the hell is Betty Palmer?

712
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,465
The woman I got rid of
from Rand Kaldor

713
00:30:46,465 --> 00:30:49,095
who tried to stop me
from doing what I did.

714
00:30:49,095 --> 00:30:50,595
Eric found her.

715
00:30:50,595 --> 00:30:53,555
You know what?
I don't care who she is.

716
00:30:53,555 --> 00:30:56,095
We're gonna fix this
by you giving them your client.

717
00:30:56,095 --> 00:30:58,265
There is no way I am
giving one of my clients

718
00:30:58,265 --> 00:31:00,685
to the man who stabbed
Robert in the back.

719
00:31:00,685 --> 00:31:02,855
There's no way I'm letting you
do God knows what

720
00:31:02,855 --> 00:31:05,105
to a woman who tried to stop you
from breaking the law.

721
00:31:05,105 --> 00:31:06,735
Goddamn it. You...
That's enough!

722
00:31:06,735 --> 00:31:09,115
Give him your client now,
or I swear to God,

723
00:31:09,115 --> 00:31:11,445
I'll hand you in
for burying evidence myself.

724
00:31:17,745 --> 00:31:20,585
I wanted to say something,
to tell him I don't trust him,

725
00:31:20,585 --> 00:31:23,215
to tell him I hate him.
Anything.

726
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,585
But I didn't.

727
00:31:25,585 --> 00:31:30,215
I just...
sat there... took it.

728
00:31:31,135 --> 00:31:32,765
Louis.

729
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,225
I'd like to try
an exercise with you.

730
00:31:36,225 --> 00:31:38,225
What kind of exercise?

731
00:31:38,225 --> 00:31:40,105
Close your eyes.

732
00:31:41,395 --> 00:31:42,935
Now,

733
00:31:42,935 --> 00:31:46,275
imagine you are walking
down that hallway with Chaz

734
00:31:46,275 --> 00:31:47,815
to the locker.

735
00:31:47,815 --> 00:31:51,075
I don't want to.
Trust me.

736
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,035
Just try it.

737
00:31:53,035 --> 00:31:57,745
And Louis, I'd like you
to envision yourself

738
00:31:57,745 --> 00:32:02,205
not as a young person,
but as you are now.

739
00:32:02,205 --> 00:32:05,085
So.

740
00:32:05,085 --> 00:32:07,215
Tell me what you see.

741
00:32:16,595 --> 00:32:18,595
It's horrible.

742
00:32:20,145 --> 00:32:22,775
I wanna stop walking,
but I can't.

743
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,605
My legs just keep going.

744
00:32:24,605 --> 00:32:26,445
I see people looking.

745
00:32:28,315 --> 00:32:30,195
Some are laughing.

746
00:32:30,195 --> 00:32:31,825
Some don't give a shit.

747
00:32:33,575 --> 00:32:36,115
The worst are the ones
who pity me.

748
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,545
We get to the gym.

749
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,915
It's empty.

750
00:32:47,045 --> 00:32:49,755
We walk up
to the equipment locker.

751
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:53,095
He opens the door.

752
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,935
I can't stop my hand.

753
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:02,145
I give him his homework.

754
00:33:02,145 --> 00:33:03,815
I don't wanna go in there,

755
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,065
but I just don't have it in me
to fight anymore.

756
00:33:06,065 --> 00:33:08,605
Louis, I need you
to go into that locker.

757
00:33:08,605 --> 00:33:11,615
- I don't wanna.
- I know.

758
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:14,945
Okay.

759
00:33:17,615 --> 00:33:20,365
Louis, one more thing.

760
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:34,675
Okay, he's in
here with me now.

761
00:33:34,675 --> 00:33:37,635
Good. Now, what
would you like to say to him?

762
00:33:37,635 --> 00:33:39,515
- I don't know.
- Louis.

763
00:33:39,515 --> 00:33:41,435
I am telling you, I don't know.

764
00:33:41,435 --> 00:33:44,815
I do. You signed a contract with
me and you didn't live up to it.

765
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:47,475
I wanted to. But I couldn't.
Why not?

766
00:33:47,475 --> 00:33:49,855
Because it's not just
about my feelings anymore.

767
00:33:49,855 --> 00:33:52,355
It's about Sheila,
our future, having a baby.

768
00:33:52,355 --> 00:33:54,985
What good is having a baby
if you can't protect it?

769
00:33:54,985 --> 00:33:57,235
That's not fair.
If I lashed out at Chaz,

770
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,655
I'd ruin our chance
at having a child to protect.

771
00:33:59,655 --> 00:34:01,495
Bullshit.
That's just an excuse.

772
00:34:01,495 --> 00:34:04,205
You didn't say anything to Chaz
because you were afraid.

773
00:34:04,205 --> 00:34:06,245
That's not true.
You gave me your word.

774
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:09,045
The word of a stupid teenager
that didn't understand.

775
00:34:09,045 --> 00:34:11,045
I grew up!
You didn't do anything

776
00:34:11,045 --> 00:34:13,255
except let him
humiliate us again.

777
00:34:13,255 --> 00:34:15,385
Like you swore
you would never do.

778
00:34:17,215 --> 00:34:18,845
You're right.

779
00:34:20,135 --> 00:34:21,805
I did.

780
00:34:24,225 --> 00:34:25,815
I was afraid.

781
00:34:28,315 --> 00:34:29,895
I'm still afraid.

782
00:34:29,895 --> 00:34:32,235
I'll always be afraid.
No, Louis, you won't.

783
00:34:32,235 --> 00:34:34,655
You don't have to be
afraid of Chaz anymore.

784
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,405
Why not?

785
00:34:36,405 --> 00:34:38,825
Because I just remembered
another promise

786
00:34:38,825 --> 00:34:41,785
we made to ourselves when
we were all alone in here.

787
00:34:41,785 --> 00:34:43,365
You mean, if no one was looking,

788
00:34:43,365 --> 00:34:45,075
we should just start...
Not that one.

789
00:34:45,075 --> 00:34:46,785
Don't judge.
We were in here a long time.

790
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:48,585
I mean, we were
in here in the dark,

791
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:50,085
wondering if we'd ever get out.

792
00:34:50,085 --> 00:34:51,755
We started to cry.

793
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:55,885
And we made a promise
to ourself that one day,

794
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:59,175
if we ever have children,
we'd teach our son

795
00:34:59,175 --> 00:35:01,425
to treat people with respect

796
00:35:01,425 --> 00:35:04,645
and to never, ever be like Chaz.

797
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,645
I'd forgotten that.
So did I.

798
00:35:07,645 --> 00:35:10,185
Until you just admitted
you were afraid too.

799
00:35:10,185 --> 00:35:14,445
If you don't mind, I'd like
to break that contract

800
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,235
so I can keep that promise.

801
00:35:16,235 --> 00:35:18,695
I don't mind.
So it's a deal?

802
00:35:18,695 --> 00:35:20,155
Deal.

803
00:35:23,825 --> 00:35:25,745
Jesus, so this is
where it comes from.

804
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,585
Hey, look at that.

805
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,215
The door's open.

806
00:35:34,755 --> 00:35:37,045
Come on. What do you say
we get out of here?

807
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:49,685
I don't know what to say, Stan.

808
00:35:51,265 --> 00:35:53,935
I never would have remembered
that promise without you.

809
00:35:53,935 --> 00:35:55,905
I just helped you see
that a part of you

810
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:58,615
has always still been
in that locker.

811
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:01,865
And what you needed was someone
to be in there with you.

812
00:36:01,865 --> 00:36:03,405
You mean you.
No, Louis.

813
00:36:03,405 --> 00:36:05,405
I mean you.

814
00:36:12,835 --> 00:36:14,215
Stop right there.

815
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:16,375
I wanna take this in.

816
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:18,585
Samantha Wheeler coming in
to kiss my ring.

817
00:36:18,585 --> 00:36:20,595
I'm not kissing shit.

818
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,215
I'm coming to give you this.

819
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:25,515
My ring or my ass,

820
00:36:25,515 --> 00:36:27,725
I don't care.
I win either way.

821
00:36:27,725 --> 00:36:29,605
No. Betty Palmer wins.

822
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:32,105
She's the one who's gonna
represent this client.

823
00:36:32,105 --> 00:36:33,525
You wanna try that again?

824
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:36,945
I said, Betty is the one
getting this client.

825
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,315
And the only reason
I'm bringing their file here

826
00:36:39,315 --> 00:36:41,025
instead of to her office
is because

827
00:36:41,025 --> 00:36:43,905
I don't think the one
you gave her is big enough

828
00:36:43,905 --> 00:36:46,285
for someone who's about
to make Senior Partner.

829
00:36:46,285 --> 00:36:48,535
I don't think you quite
get how losing works.

830
00:36:48,535 --> 00:36:50,825
You see, you don't get
to dictate the terms...

831
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:51,835
I didn't lose, Eric.

832
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:53,245
I chose not to fight anymore.

833
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:55,335
But I could change my mind.
Bullshit.

834
00:36:55,335 --> 00:36:58,875
You're trying to ease your guilt
about screwing over a woman

835
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:00,715
who was trying
to do the right thing.

836
00:37:00,715 --> 00:37:02,255
You're right, I am.

837
00:37:02,255 --> 00:37:03,675
And you have no idea

838
00:37:03,675 --> 00:37:06,595
how much losing this client
is gonna cost me.

839
00:37:06,595 --> 00:37:08,685
But Betty does.

840
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:12,055
Which means she'd be more than
happy to dig through your files

841
00:37:12,055 --> 00:37:14,435
and find my original
billing sheet.

842
00:37:14,435 --> 00:37:17,525
You know, the one that can get
you kicked out of the bar?

843
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,905
Eric, you said
if I brought the client over,

844
00:37:21,905 --> 00:37:23,825
this would be over.
It's not my fault

845
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,285
you're a shitty negotiator.

846
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,495
So make Betty
a Senior Partner and move on,

847
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,535
or this firm is gonna lose
another name off its wall.

848
00:37:30,535 --> 00:37:34,035
And this time, it'll be yours.

849
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,635
Gretchen, can I
talk to you for a second?

850
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:43,755
- Don't tell me.
- You were right.

851
00:37:43,755 --> 00:37:46,965
They did demand
that Alex fire you.

852
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:48,055
He refused.

853
00:37:48,055 --> 00:37:49,595
No. Mm-mm.

854
00:37:50,765 --> 00:37:53,435
I can't let that happen.
What?

855
00:37:53,435 --> 00:37:56,935
I'm going to tell Robert
it was my fault. I'll retire.

856
00:37:56,935 --> 00:37:59,565
Maybe that'll save Alex his client.
What happened

857
00:37:59,565 --> 00:38:02,485
was as much my fault as yours.
Alex was right.

858
00:38:02,485 --> 00:38:04,405
I-I should've
followed up with Leroy.

859
00:38:04,405 --> 00:38:05,655
It was a simple mistake.

860
00:38:05,655 --> 00:38:08,245
And I should have
been able to fix it!

861
00:38:11,575 --> 00:38:14,335
I tried to call in
every favor I could.

862
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:18,125
That woman laughed me
out of the office.

863
00:38:18,915 --> 00:38:20,465
And I always told myself

864
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:23,545
when I ran out of juice,
I'd hang it up.

865
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:29,345
Well, turns out
I'm squeezed dry.

866
00:38:31,385 --> 00:38:34,095
Gretchen, I can't tell you
when it's time.

867
00:38:35,645 --> 00:38:38,225
But I can tell you that
it took Mike going to prison

868
00:38:38,225 --> 00:38:40,935
for Harvey to learn that
some mistakes can't be fixed.

869
00:38:40,935 --> 00:38:42,695
And I'll tell you
something else.

870
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,195
The night that Mike went away,

871
00:38:44,195 --> 00:38:46,075
Harvey thought about
hanging it up too.

872
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:48,905
But if he tapped out, he
couldn't fight to get Mike out,

873
00:38:48,905 --> 00:38:50,365
and deep down, he knew

874
00:38:50,365 --> 00:38:52,745
that he still had
a lot of fight left in him.

875
00:38:53,955 --> 00:38:55,625
What if I don't?

876
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,875
You wouldn't be telling me
this if you didn't.

877
00:38:57,875 --> 00:39:01,005
Because offering to retire
is just another way

878
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,625
of fighting to fix it.

879
00:39:05,295 --> 00:39:08,255
How am I supposed to look
Alex in the eye tomorrow?

880
00:39:08,255 --> 00:39:10,265
You just do it.

881
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,095
And it will be okay.

882
00:39:12,095 --> 00:39:14,725
Because someone who would
offer to pack it in for him

883
00:39:14,725 --> 00:39:16,435
doesn't come around very often.

884
00:39:16,435 --> 00:39:17,805
In fact, when he finds out,

885
00:39:17,805 --> 00:39:19,815
I bet he is in my office
bright and early,

886
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,475
saying you should get a raise.

887
00:39:21,475 --> 00:39:23,695
You saying you're willing
to give me a raise?

888
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,815
No. You just lost this firm
a huge client.

889
00:39:27,735 --> 00:39:29,195
Thanks, Red.

890
00:39:30,865 --> 00:39:33,655
I hope that when you're
thinking about packing it in,

891
00:39:33,655 --> 00:39:37,575
you have someone like you
to talk you out of it too.

892
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,705
Gretchen.

893
00:39:41,665 --> 00:39:43,545
Get yourself on over here.

894
00:39:48,175 --> 00:39:49,545
Hey.

895
00:39:49,545 --> 00:39:51,305
Is it done?

896
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,805
It's done.

897
00:39:54,385 --> 00:39:57,595
For what it's worth,
we threw some good punches.

898
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,645
It just doesn't feel that way.

899
00:39:59,645 --> 00:40:02,105
Well, maybe that's a good thing.

900
00:40:02,105 --> 00:40:03,485
How's that?

901
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:05,525
Because the next time
Kaldor comes around,

902
00:40:05,525 --> 00:40:07,565
you're gonna remember
how this felt.

903
00:40:09,405 --> 00:40:12,485
What do you say we hit the gym
and go a few rounds?

904
00:40:12,485 --> 00:40:14,955
Not tonight.
Why not?

905
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:19,245
Because I'd feel bad that I lost
a client, and I'd let you win.

906
00:40:19,245 --> 00:40:21,795
And I don't wanna let you win.
You really think

907
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:24,005
you can beat me, don't you?
I know I can.

908
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:26,295
Isn't that what you thought
about Eric Kaldor?

909
00:40:26,295 --> 00:40:28,175
That's different,
and you know it.

910
00:40:29,585 --> 00:40:32,005
Let me tell you
something, Samantha.

911
00:40:32,005 --> 00:40:35,305
I never thought I could lose
until Mike Ross went to prison.

912
00:40:35,305 --> 00:40:38,145
I still don't ever think
I'm gonna lose.

913
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:42,765
But I know in the back of
my mind that, one time, I did.

914
00:40:42,765 --> 00:40:45,145
It's just a thought.

915
00:40:46,025 --> 00:40:48,695
I'll keep that in mind.

916
00:40:48,695 --> 00:40:52,325
Goodnight, Harvey.
Goodnight, Samantha.

917
00:40:53,655 --> 00:40:55,745
Harvey.

918
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:58,115
Just so you know,
if I had another chance

919
00:40:58,115 --> 00:41:00,915
to keep an innocent woman out
of prison, I'd do it again.

920
00:41:00,915 --> 00:41:04,165
That's between you
and your maker.

921
00:41:04,165 --> 00:41:06,255
But if there is a next time,

922
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:09,625
how about you make sure
there aren't any Betty Palmers?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
