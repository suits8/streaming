1
00:00:00,078 --> 00:00:01,313
<i>Previously on "Suits"...</i>

2
00:00:01,314 --> 00:00:02,409
I had a nightmare last night

3
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,876
that we made Louis
Managing Partner.

4
00:00:03,911 --> 00:00:04,877
I couldn't get back
to sleep till dawn.

5
00:00:04,912 --> 00:00:06,812
That wasn't a nightmare
and you know it.

6
00:00:07,177 --> 00:00:10,641
I cannot let my clients down.
It's just not in me.

7
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:12,477
Louis, I just found us
a new managing partner.

8
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:14,545
I think I can handle
finding Thomas Kessler

9
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,780
a new general counsel.

10
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:17,448
Now, the better question is,

11
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:19,417
can you handle this job
that you agreed to take?

12
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:21,330
I was just thinking about
where we were a week ago

13
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,698
when I thought you were cold
and heartless

14
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:24,622
and I went from that
to being your best friend.

15
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,068
What's going on with you
and Brian?

16
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:27,825
Donna, he's married.
I would never do--

17
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,838
I know, but I also know
that the heart doesn't always

18
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:31,829
listen to what the brain says
it would never do.

19
00:00:31,864 --> 00:00:33,304
Finding you
the right general counsel

20
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:35,166
isn't just about
knowing your business.

21
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,667
No, it's about chemistry.

22
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:39,162
- Yes, it is.
- How do you know my type?

23
00:00:39,163 --> 00:00:40,974
Life is going to put
that special someone right

24
00:00:40,998 --> 00:00:42,698
in front of you
and when it happens,

25
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:43,899
I know you'll be ready.

26
00:00:43,934 --> 00:00:45,601
Truth is,
I am running this place

27
00:00:45,636 --> 00:00:47,402
and we all need to get on
board with that

28
00:00:47,438 --> 00:00:49,938
and it starts
with you reading me in.

29
00:00:49,974 --> 00:00:51,640
Have dinner with me.

30
00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:54,176
Thomas, I'm flattered
but you're a client and--

31
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:55,422
<i>I'm gonna give you</i>
<i>a bit of time</i>

32
00:00:55,446 --> 00:00:57,112
and if you still feel
the same way

33
00:00:57,147 --> 00:00:58,647
then I promise
I will never ask again.

34
00:00:58,682 --> 00:00:59,615
<i>Fair?</i>

35
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,716
Fair.

36
00:01:09,226 --> 00:01:10,359
Well?

37
00:01:12,096 --> 00:01:13,629
Well what?

38
00:01:13,664 --> 00:01:15,964
Are you gonna say yes
to your mystery man?

39
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,999
What are you talking about?

40
00:01:18,034 --> 00:01:19,501
You think we didn't
all catch you

41
00:01:19,536 --> 00:01:21,018
looking at your phone
all night?

42
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:22,051
Those were work texts.

43
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:24,254
Work tests don't use emojize.

44
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:25,566
- It's emojis.
- Don't change the subject.

45
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,324
The point is you got a man
who wants to go out with you.

46
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,794
Gretchen,
it's not just any man.

47
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:32,228
It's Thomas Kessler.

48
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:33,775
Well, if you think
Louis would object

49
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:36,065
because he's a client--
- No, it's not just that--

50
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:37,500
Well, what is it?

51
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,636
Because you clearly like him
so what's stopping you

52
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:41,137
from going out on a simple date

53
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:44,073
and maybe getting
your freak on.

54
00:01:45,277 --> 00:01:47,343
Nothing, Gretchen.

55
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,747
Absolutely freaking nothing.

56
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,823
Harvey, can I talk
to you a second?

57
00:01:56,847 --> 00:01:58,313
Sure, Louis,
what's on your mind?

58
00:01:58,349 --> 00:01:59,882
Well...

59
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:01,984
I wanted to say,
I shouldn't have yelled

60
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:03,585
at you and Robert about Malik.

61
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:05,454
I should have heard you
when you came to me

62
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:06,667
and let you know
how I was feeling.

63
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:08,323
It's okay, Louis,

64
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:09,191
I should have made
you listen to me

65
00:02:09,226 --> 00:02:10,726
like Robert said
in the first place.

66
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:12,294
Well, I've been thinking.

67
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:15,064
I'm trying to be
the best leader I can

68
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:18,202
and a good leader inspires
people to do what they do best,

69
00:02:18,203 --> 00:02:20,036
and what you do best,
Harvey, is close.

70
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:21,838
Can't argue with you there.

71
00:02:21,873 --> 00:02:23,784
So what do you say you go out
and land a big whale for us?

72
00:02:23,808 --> 00:02:25,508
I get it.

73
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:27,455
You're a new captain, you want
to make a new statement.

74
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,145
I want us to make
a new statement.

75
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,691
Well, in that case,
I did hear that Steven Palmer

76
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:32,582
is looking for
new representation.

77
00:02:32,617 --> 00:02:34,350
Well, you get that harpoon
sharpened

78
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:36,264
because I'll be expecting
a nice piece of scrimshaw

79
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:37,620
by the end of the week,
matey.

80
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:39,422
- The hell is scrimshaw?
- Carved whale bone.

81
00:02:39,457 --> 00:02:40,290
What the hell's
matter with you?

82
00:02:40,325 --> 00:02:41,402
Where'd you get your education?

83
00:02:41,426 --> 00:02:43,226
Not in the 1800s,
I can tell you that.

84
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:44,761
Well, for your information,

85
00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:45,906
scrimshaw dates back
to the mid-1700s--

86
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,363
And if you finish
that sentence,

87
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,876
there's no way I'm going
after Palmer.

88
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,733
Consider the sentence
unfinished.

89
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:52,524
- Louis.
- Yeah.

90
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,528
It takes a big man to come
in here and say all that.

91
00:02:56,564 --> 00:02:58,497
I appreciate that

92
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:01,734
and I'll get you your whale.

93
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,204
Chips ahoy, Harvey.

94
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,996
One decaf chai tea,
three sugars.

95
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:15,365
Brian, you're my associate,
not my assistant.

96
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,978
You don't have to bring me
my preferred beverage

97
00:03:17,002 --> 00:03:18,701
when I ask to see you
in my office.

98
00:03:18,737 --> 00:03:20,348
Oh, I can give it to Louis,
if you don't want it.

99
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:22,071
Gimme that,

100
00:03:22,107 --> 00:03:24,147
and it just so happens
I have something for you too.

101
00:03:27,112 --> 00:03:28,845
Katrina, I don't really
wear women's--

102
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,580
Chelsea Conner's Adored.

103
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:34,293
As in, Chelsea Conner
the makeup and fragrance giant.

104
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:36,629
Don't tell me, they're
looking for representation.

105
00:03:36,664 --> 00:03:38,109
They reached out to me
this morning.

106
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:40,177
Apparently they heard about
our Hi-Rise Fashion victory

107
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:42,146
and now Chelsea wants us to go
after a rival company

108
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,771
who's copying
their flagship fragrance.

109
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:48,269
Brian, I think I might have
found my partner specialty.

110
00:03:48,304 --> 00:03:49,637
Consumer goods.

111
00:03:49,672 --> 00:03:51,839
It's not as sexy
or exciting as tax law,

112
00:03:51,874 --> 00:03:53,574
but let's face it,
what is?

113
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,309
You don't get out much,
do you?

114
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:56,477
You know what I mean.

115
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:58,045
I do.

116
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,613
What do you need me to do?

117
00:03:59,649 --> 00:04:01,660
Find out everything there is
to know about our product

118
00:04:01,684 --> 00:04:03,495
and theirs and figure out a way
to shut them down.

119
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,085
Consider it done.

120
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:06,980
And hey, for the record,

121
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:09,049
this is your victory
as much as mine.

122
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:11,785
Thanks, Katrina.

123
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:20,866
It's got pretty good speed,

124
00:04:20,901 --> 00:04:22,534
for something
that runs on plants.

125
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:27,191
Uh, that particular vehicle
runs on 91 unleaded.

126
00:04:27,227 --> 00:04:29,727
But you're gonna make one
like it that doesn't

127
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:31,707
because you're more interested
in changing the world

128
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:33,064
than you are in making money.

129
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:34,365
For a guy I've never met,

130
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,900
you know a lot about
my business.

131
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:38,302
I make it my business to know
a lot about my clients,

132
00:04:38,338 --> 00:04:39,437
Harvey Specter.

133
00:04:39,472 --> 00:04:41,305
And I take it you heard
I'm on the market.

134
00:04:41,341 --> 00:04:43,140
What I've heard is you're
looking for a guy

135
00:04:43,176 --> 00:04:44,308
to kill it for you.

136
00:04:44,344 --> 00:04:45,584
And you think
you're that guy.

137
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:46,486
I know I am.

138
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:48,354
People said you were cocky.

139
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,790
People said I was confident
and I am,

140
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:52,425
but only because
I can back it up.

141
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,373
But I'm afraid you, uh,
wasted your trip,

142
00:04:55,374 --> 00:04:57,341
because I'm not
signing with you.

143
00:04:57,376 --> 00:04:58,909
- Why not?
- You have a reputation.

144
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:01,855
My reputation is being the
best closer in the city,

145
00:05:01,856 --> 00:05:04,557
which is exactly why
you should sign with me.

146
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,951
It's also that you never do
what you're told,

147
00:05:06,986 --> 00:05:08,753
and I may consider myself
a maverick,

148
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:10,065
but I don't want
my lawyer to be one.

149
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:11,822
- Steven--
- Harvey, I just said no

150
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:14,191
and the reason is
that you don't listen.

151
00:05:14,227 --> 00:05:15,838
So if you even want a shot at
my business,

152
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:17,595
your best chance at changing
my mind

153
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,297
would be to turn around
and let me be.

154
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:25,302
What do you say to that?

155
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:28,339
Hell of a car, Steven.

156
00:05:28,374 --> 00:05:29,311
Hell of a car.

00:06:12,353 --> 00:06:14,087
but, um,
which question was that

174
00:06:14,122 --> 00:06:16,122
because I'm a very,
uh, curious person.

175
00:06:16,157 --> 00:06:17,123
I ask a lot of questions.

176
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:18,958
Okay, I get it.

177
00:06:18,993 --> 00:06:20,460
You want to hear me
say the words.

178
00:06:20,495 --> 00:06:22,061
Yes, I will go out with you.

179
00:06:22,097 --> 00:06:23,262
I might have.

180
00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:24,298
Well, I just did.

181
00:06:24,332 --> 00:06:26,032
<i>Good, in that case,</i>

182
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:27,733
<i>the answer to your question</i>
<i>is also yes.</i>

183
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:29,202
I didn't ask you a question.

184
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:31,015
But you were going to ask if
I made reservations,

185
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,872
and yes,
I already made some.

186
00:06:32,907 --> 00:06:34,407
How could you know that?

187
00:06:34,442 --> 00:06:36,709
Well, one, I'm an optimist

188
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:39,612
and, two, I know you've spent
your entire career

189
00:06:39,647 --> 00:06:40,913
making plans for other people

190
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:42,482
and I thought you might
appreciate

191
00:06:42,517 --> 00:06:43,850
someone making plans for you.

192
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:45,618
Yeah, I would.

193
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:47,487
<i>Here's what I want you</i>
<i>to do.</i>

194
00:06:47,522 --> 00:06:49,300
<i>Be ready for me to pick</i>
<i>you up tomorrow night at 7:00,</i>

195
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:53,526
wear something stunning and,
um, hope to God I show up.

196
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:55,495
Done.

197
00:06:56,489 --> 00:07:00,224
And Thomas, why did you want
to hear me say it?

198
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:04,495
Because I may be an optimist
but it's still nice to hear.

199
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:08,432
I'll see you tomorrow night
then.

200
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:11,168
And then he tries
to tell me he was right.

201
00:07:11,204 --> 00:07:14,004
The man shows up 30 minutes
late to our date

202
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,361
and I'm hearing some bullshit
about Johnson v. Florida.

203
00:07:17,362 --> 00:07:18,165
He didn't.

204
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,010
Hey, that's what she gets
for dating a law student.

205
00:07:20,034 --> 00:07:22,396
Uh, no, I was also
a law student

206
00:07:22,397 --> 00:07:25,214
and somehow I still managed to
communicate like a human being.

207
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:26,592
Well, I believe
my skills have gotten

208
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:28,282
a lot better since then.
- Oh, really?

209
00:07:28,318 --> 00:07:30,585
How are his "I'm-sorry's"
and "you-were-right-honey's"?

210
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,220
- How do you think they are?
- You know,

211
00:07:32,255 --> 00:07:33,966
I'm starting to think
this lunch was a bad idea.

212
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,089
To be honest,

213
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,425
I was surprised you suggested
it in the first place.

214
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,097
Well, the truth is Alex
didn't suggest it, I did.

215
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:42,697
Well, now I'm curious.

216
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:44,899
Rosalie figured
we'd just been through a war

217
00:07:44,935 --> 00:07:46,946
and what better way to start
fresh than by breaking bread

218
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,903
and I figured,
you've already met Joy

219
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:50,639
and this couldn't go
any worse.

220
00:07:50,674 --> 00:07:52,007
Though, clearly,
I was wrong.

221
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:54,075
Well,
there is another reason

222
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,044
I wanted to sit down
and have lunch.

223
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,714
After I had my babies,
I left my law firm

224
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,583
and I wanted to raise them,

225
00:08:01,618 --> 00:08:05,520
but they are older now and it's
time to get back in the game.

226
00:08:05,555 --> 00:08:08,089
Wait a second,
is this about your case?

227
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,591
It is.

228
00:08:09,626 --> 00:08:11,204
I've got dozens
of graduates that went to

229
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:12,394
a worthless university,

230
00:08:12,429 --> 00:08:15,063
they got a worthless degree
and now they're in debt.

231
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:16,258
And you've been thinking
you could use

232
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,838
a little help with it.
- Yes, Yes I could.

233
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,950
Rosalie,
we didn't talk about--

234
00:08:19,974 --> 00:08:22,407
Quiet, Alex,
your wife and I are talking.

235
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,144
What kind of help do you need?

236
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,180
Robert Zane, just the man
I was looking to see.

237
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:30,160
Whatever it is, Louis,
I have a tee time in an hour.

238
00:08:30,184 --> 00:08:32,484
Well, that's okay,
this won't take long.

239
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,319
What are those?
My walking papers?

240
00:08:34,355 --> 00:08:36,722
Rigoletto tickets,
best in the house.

241
00:08:36,757 --> 00:08:37,956
I know Laura's a fan.

242
00:08:37,992 --> 00:08:39,202
I wish these were
my walking papers.

243
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:41,059
Oh, sorry,
I didn't mean to--

244
00:08:41,095 --> 00:08:43,628
I'm just kidding, Louis,
this is a wonderful gesture.

245
00:08:43,664 --> 00:08:45,519
Do you mind if I ask
what it's for?

246
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,365
I know that it couldn't
have been easy for you

247
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:49,200
stepping down for me,
so I just wanted to show you

248
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:50,356
how much I appreciate it.

249
00:08:50,392 --> 00:08:51,991
Thank you, Louis,
means a lot.

250
00:08:52,026 --> 00:08:53,971
Louis, Gretchen texted
that you wanted to see me.

251
00:08:53,995 --> 00:08:55,906
Yeah, I wanted to see
how it went with Steven Palmer.

252
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,441
How do you think it went?
I got him on the one yard line.

253
00:08:57,465 --> 00:08:59,966
Harvey, English, please.
You know I don't know baseball.

254
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:01,379
In that case,
the fat lady's singing.

255
00:09:01,403 --> 00:09:02,935
That's music to my ears.

256
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:04,412
Should I lob a call
to get her to wrap it up?

257
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:06,572
- Not necessary, Louis.
- I got it.

258
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:08,302
You're all over it,
I won't push.

259
00:09:08,326 --> 00:09:10,693
Robert, enjoy the tix.
Gentlemen.

260
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:13,796
Fat lady singing my ass.

261
00:09:13,832 --> 00:09:15,264
Excuse me?

262
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,366
The only one yard line
you're on is your own.

263
00:09:17,402 --> 00:09:19,101
How do you know that?

264
00:09:19,137 --> 00:09:20,981
Because it's a lot easier
to tell someone's lying

265
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:22,116
when they're lying
to someone else.

266
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,240
Well, for your information,
I'm not really lying

267
00:09:24,275 --> 00:09:26,334
because it doesn't matter
what yard line,

268
00:09:26,335 --> 00:09:27,431
I'm landing this guy.

269
00:09:27,644 --> 00:09:29,644
Boy, I am glad I'm not
managing you anymore

270
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,657
because that is some prime cut
Harvey Specter bullshit.

271
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:33,681
- Yeah.
- Speaking of fat ladies,

272
00:09:33,716 --> 00:09:35,416
you want these opera tickets?

273
00:09:35,452 --> 00:09:37,196
'Cause there's no way
I'm letting Laura drag me

274
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,464
to another four hour
snooze fest.

275
00:09:38,488 --> 00:09:40,555
- I don't really.
- That's a good man.

276
00:09:44,948 --> 00:09:47,648
I have to say,
I really think you married up.

277
00:09:47,684 --> 00:09:49,717
I've been saying
that for years,

278
00:09:49,752 --> 00:09:52,753
but right now,
I need to say something else.

279
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:54,600
I don't want you taking
that case with Rosalie.

280
00:09:54,624 --> 00:09:56,568
Yeah, I think you made
that pretty clear at lunch.

281
00:09:56,592 --> 00:09:58,225
The question is, why not?

282
00:09:58,261 --> 00:09:59,772
You want me to list
all the hundred reasons?

283
00:09:59,796 --> 00:10:01,462
Come on, Alex,
Rosalie said it herself.

284
00:10:01,497 --> 00:10:03,030
We just went to war,

285
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:04,398
and I know you know what
happened

286
00:10:04,434 --> 00:10:06,200
between me and Katrina.

287
00:10:06,235 --> 00:10:08,502
We need something
to bring us together.

288
00:10:08,538 --> 00:10:10,071
Then let's have
a bake sale,

289
00:10:10,106 --> 00:10:11,917
because there's a reason
she and I don't mix work

290
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:12,807
and our relationship.

291
00:10:12,842 --> 00:10:14,675
Alex, I already told her
I would help

292
00:10:14,711 --> 00:10:16,255
and I am not going to break
my word to your wife.

293
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,945
Then I want to be clear right
now.

294
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:19,858
I don't care what happens,
you leave me out of it

295
00:10:19,882 --> 00:10:21,961
because you're two strong
women who have strong opinions

296
00:10:21,985 --> 00:10:23,262
about anything you've
ever thought

297
00:10:23,286 --> 00:10:25,164
and I don't want to be caught
in the middle of it.

298
00:10:25,188 --> 00:10:26,620
Well,
I can't speak for Rosalie,

299
00:10:26,656 --> 00:10:27,700
but as far as I am concerned,

300
00:10:27,724 --> 00:10:29,957
you will never hear one word
about this case from me.

301
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:35,061
Linda Janowitz,
I'm Katrina Bennett,

302
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:36,296
this is Brian Altman.

303
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:38,165
We're here on behalf
of Chelsea Conner.

304
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,410
In that case, this
should be a short meeting.

305
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:42,235
If you prefer a long court
fight, that can be arranged.

306
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:45,205
Actually, it's been arranged.

307
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,840
You're trying
to shut me down?

308
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,108
This is a joke.

309
00:10:48,143 --> 00:10:49,109
Oh, I don't think
you'll be laughing

310
00:10:49,144 --> 00:10:51,111
when a court orders you
to close your doors

311
00:10:51,146 --> 00:10:52,146
and burn your product.

312
00:10:52,394 --> 00:10:53,327
And why would they do that?

313
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:55,195
Because,
as you're well aware,

314
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:56,597
there's a 97% overlap

315
00:10:56,632 --> 00:10:58,799
between the packaging
of your product and Adored.

316
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:00,579
It's not because we're
copying your product

317
00:11:00,603 --> 00:11:01,603
and we can prove it.

318
00:11:01,637 --> 00:11:03,237
- Bullshit.
- Is it?

319
00:11:03,272 --> 00:11:05,138
We market-tested every aspect
of our packaging

320
00:11:05,174 --> 00:11:06,873
and based on all our focus
groups,

321
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:10,055
the color that women found
most appealing was red.

322
00:11:10,056 --> 00:11:13,591
They also responded to cursive
lettering and gold foil trim,

323
00:11:13,627 --> 00:11:14,893
so that's what we gave them.

324
00:11:14,928 --> 00:11:16,694
What you gave them is
a carbon copy

325
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,563
of my client's flagship
product.

326
00:11:18,598 --> 00:11:20,865
And as for focus groups,
the best one I know is a jury.

327
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:22,634
So, pull your product
from the shelves,

328
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:25,537
repackage with a new name, and
that lawsuit never gets filed.

329
00:11:25,572 --> 00:11:27,372
Except for one thing.

330
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:29,978
There's no way you prove our
product is a knock-off of yours

331
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:32,780
when, among other things, they
smell completely different,

332
00:11:32,815 --> 00:11:35,383
which anyone who takes
one whiff of them can tell.

333
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,123
- Hello.
<i>- Steven.</i>

334
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:42,828
Louis Litt
of Zane Specter Litt.

335
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:43,837
Uh, is now a good time?

336
00:11:43,838 --> 00:11:45,500
You must have gotten
your wires crossed, Louis.

337
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:46,812
Your firm already paid me
a visit today.

338
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:49,447
I know that, I know Harvey
has you well in hand.

339
00:11:49,448 --> 00:11:52,228
I just want to tell you how
much we value your business.

340
00:11:52,229 --> 00:11:54,262
Value my business?
You don't have my business.

341
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:56,298
Right, well, I--I know
it's not official yet. I just--

342
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,400
Okay, let me tell you
what I told Harvey,

343
00:11:58,435 --> 00:12:01,569
I am not interested
in your firm representing me.

344
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:03,805
I see.

345
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,907
Do you mind if I ask why not?

346
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:07,442
I'll tell you
what I told him,

347
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,255
he has a reputation
for not doing what he's told.

348
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,713
Well, I certainly can't argue
with that,

349
00:12:11,748 --> 00:12:13,782
but I do not have
that reputation

350
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,051
and I have just
become Managing Partner.

351
00:12:16,086 --> 00:12:17,614
<i>If you just give me a chance</i>
<i>to sit down with you--</i>

352
00:12:17,615 --> 00:12:18,826
You want a chance to sit down
with me?

353
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,139
I'm having a charity poker
event tonight.

354
00:12:23,112 --> 00:12:24,149
Well, in that case, I'll--

355
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,484
Before you answer,
it'll cost you $100,000.

356
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,220
<i>So if you're willing to part</i>
<i>with that amount of money,</i>

357
00:12:29,255 --> 00:12:31,355
I'll see you there
but I have to tell you,

358
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:34,025
if you can't tell when
Harvey Specter's playing you,

359
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,793
I'm not sure
it'll be worth your time.

360
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,382
Anything?

361
00:12:40,383 --> 00:12:41,926
I've been thinking about it
all afternoon.

362
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,283
Without proof they're lying,

363
00:12:43,318 --> 00:12:44,217
we have no way
to make our case.

364
00:12:44,253 --> 00:12:45,118
Shit.

365
00:12:45,154 --> 00:12:46,119
Katrina,
we can still back out.

366
00:12:46,155 --> 00:12:48,388
No. We back out now,

367
00:12:48,424 --> 00:12:50,190
Chelsea's brand is
going to mean nothing,

368
00:12:50,225 --> 00:12:52,203
not to mention the fact my
specialty goes out the window.

369
00:12:52,227 --> 00:12:53,727
So what are we going to do?

370
00:12:53,762 --> 00:12:55,257
We have no choice, we have
to try to get Linda Janowitz

371
00:12:55,258 --> 00:12:56,991
to break in a deposition.

372
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,457
Which isn't going to be easy,
because we have no evidence.

373
00:13:00,374 --> 00:13:01,940
Wait a second, maybe we do.

374
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,091
What do you mean?

375
00:13:03,092 --> 00:13:04,924
They lied about
the packaging.

376
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,927
What's to say they aren't lying
about the perfumes themselves.

377
00:13:07,962 --> 00:13:09,562
Oh, my God, you're right.

378
00:13:09,597 --> 00:13:11,664
They might smell
exactly alike.

379
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,446
I can't tell if they smell
the same or different.

380
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,981
That's because you're
smelling them wrong.

381
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,371
Here.

382
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
Try it now.

383
00:13:30,966 --> 00:13:33,033
Keep your eyes closed,

384
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:34,868
it focuses your senses.

385
00:13:53,451 --> 00:13:54,583
Brian?

386
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:03,192
- Yeah?
- What do you think?

387
00:14:03,227 --> 00:14:05,161
Uh, they are different.

388
00:14:05,196 --> 00:14:08,597
Well, perfume is
a personal thing.

389
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:11,066
It has to do with how it
interacts with a person's skin

390
00:14:11,102 --> 00:14:16,272
and pheromones and--
it's a personal thing.

391
00:14:16,307 --> 00:14:18,908
Yeah, personal.

392
00:14:22,713 --> 00:14:25,080
Looks like our work
is cut out for us.

393
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:27,683
We're gonna have to drop
everything and focus on this.

394
00:14:27,718 --> 00:14:29,151
I can't.

395
00:14:29,187 --> 00:14:30,931
- What do you mean?
- I know I'm your associate,

396
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:32,733
but I've been on the
Hardwick team for six months

397
00:14:32,757 --> 00:14:34,157
and tonight is
the final doc review.

398
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:35,836
Well, there are
other people on that team.

399
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,827
I--I don't have anyone else.

400
00:14:37,862 --> 00:14:39,528
What does that mean?

401
00:14:39,564 --> 00:14:42,364
It means I'm going
to get you out of it.

402
00:14:46,696 --> 00:14:47,950
I've got to say,

403
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:50,752
this is an impressive operation
you got your name on.

404
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,531
Well, there's a reason
Alex and I went to war,

405
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:55,144
but I can't believe this is
the first time

406
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:56,133
you're seeing the offices.

407
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:57,968
It's not.

408
00:14:58,004 --> 00:15:00,082
It's just the first time I'm
looking at it through new eyes.

409
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:01,150
Ah, and what kind
of eyes are those?

410
00:15:01,174 --> 00:15:03,107
The kind that are looking
to intimidate.

411
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:03,974
I'm listening.

412
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,910
I've got a bunch of victims

413
00:15:05,945 --> 00:15:09,013
who were promised
the moon and the stars,

414
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:10,915
a job placement
rate close to zero

415
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,616
and an administration

416
00:15:12,652 --> 00:15:14,593
that claims those promises
were never made.

417
00:15:14,594 --> 00:15:16,060
So in other words,
they're lying.

418
00:15:16,096 --> 00:15:18,930
Yes, but I need
an office like this

419
00:15:18,965 --> 00:15:21,869
and a partner like you to get
him to admit what he knows.

420
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,503
And then?

421
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:25,572
Because even if he breaks
at deposition,

422
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:27,340
we can only commit
so much manpower.

423
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:28,675
I'm not looking
to go to trial.

424
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:30,310
I'm looking to close
in the room.

425
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:32,612
And how exactly
are you gonna do that?

426
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:36,917
I was thinking something
like this.

427
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:41,254
Well, I just like you
more and more.

428
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,989
Let's get something
on the books

429
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,225
because these clowns are not
going to know what hit 'em.

430
00:15:48,172 --> 00:15:49,671
Katrina, if you're here to
suggest

431
00:15:49,707 --> 00:15:50,511
that we go out for
drinks again,

432
00:15:50,512 --> 00:15:53,079
I would love to but
it just so happens that I--

433
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,647
That's not why I'm here,
Donna.

434
00:15:54,682 --> 00:15:56,393
I need you to clear Brian's
schedule tonight

435
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:57,850
and before you say anything--

436
00:15:57,885 --> 00:16:01,253
Okay, I'll take care of it.
He's all yours.

437
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:02,421
That's it?

438
00:16:02,456 --> 00:16:03,906
You're not going to tell me
that he's been working on

439
00:16:03,907 --> 00:16:05,100
the Hardwick case
for six months

440
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:06,033
and you can't just
pull him off now?

441
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:08,202
No, why would I
tell you that?

442
00:16:08,831 --> 00:16:11,598
And why do you look like you
want me to tell you that?

443
00:16:12,498 --> 00:16:14,031
Katrina, what's going on?

444
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:18,269
Brian and I had a moment.

445
00:16:18,304 --> 00:16:19,704
A moment-moment?

446
00:16:19,739 --> 00:16:22,974
Yes, Donna,

447
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:25,443
a moment-moment.

448
00:16:25,478 --> 00:16:28,245
Okay, I--I don't want this
to come off wrong,

449
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:31,282
but did you share a moment

450
00:16:31,317 --> 00:16:32,494
or did just you have a moment?

451
00:16:32,518 --> 00:16:34,585
We had a moment, Donna,

452
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,657
and nothing happened
but it was 100% a moment.

453
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:41,905
But I need his help
on this case, Donna,

454
00:16:41,906 --> 00:16:43,005
he's my associate,

455
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,808
I can't just hide from him
the rest of my life.

456
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:47,454
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

457
00:16:47,478 --> 00:16:49,144
No, I'm not.

458
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,814
Then I just have
one piece of advice.

459
00:16:51,849 --> 00:16:53,515
If you don't want
to eat a cookie,

460
00:16:53,551 --> 00:16:55,484
stay out of the kitchen.

461
00:17:00,224 --> 00:17:01,056
- Louis.
- Hey, how's it going?

462
00:17:01,092 --> 00:17:03,125
Nice weather we're having.

463
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,138
You mind telling me why
you lied about Steven Palmer?

464
00:17:05,162 --> 00:17:06,340
- Listen to me--
- No, I talked to him, Harvey.

465
00:17:06,364 --> 00:17:07,629
So before you lie to me again--

466
00:17:07,665 --> 00:17:09,612
I didn't lie to you.
I told you I had him and I do.

467
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:12,481
Then why did he tell me he
wants nothing to do with you?

468
00:17:12,516 --> 00:17:14,127
Because that's what all
the girls say, Louis.

469
00:17:14,151 --> 00:17:16,318
And that's exactly what
he's talking about,

470
00:17:16,353 --> 00:17:17,252
you don't listen.

471
00:17:17,288 --> 00:17:18,331
- I don't what?
- You heard me.

472
00:17:18,355 --> 00:17:21,223
You didn't listen.
- I was sure listening

473
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:22,369
when you said you weren't
going to call him.

474
00:17:22,393 --> 00:17:25,360
I said I wasn't going to
push and I didn't.

475
00:17:25,396 --> 00:17:27,262
What I did was determine
that I can't trust you

476
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:28,063
and now I'm taking over.

477
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:29,364
The hell you are!

478
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,632
I heard him loud and clear.

479
00:17:30,668 --> 00:17:31,745
He wanted me to show him
that I respect him

480
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:34,236
and that's exactly what
I'm going to do tonight.

481
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:35,949
Oh, that's right.
I know, at his poker game.

482
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,150
Well, there's a change
of plans, Harvey,

483
00:17:37,174 --> 00:17:39,508
because Zane Specter Litt is
still going to that game,

484
00:17:39,543 --> 00:17:41,154
but Litt's going to be
the one at the table.

485
00:17:41,178 --> 00:17:42,123
You go to that game,

486
00:17:42,124 --> 00:17:43,234
all you're going to do
is show Palmer

487
00:17:43,258 --> 00:17:45,296
that you don't know shit
about poker.

488
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,764
And you go there,
all you're going to do is prove

489
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,066
is all care about is yourself.

490
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,525
So why don't you
prove us both wrong

491
00:17:50,526 --> 00:17:51,637
and do what you're told
for a change

492
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:53,330
and back the hell off
my client.

493
00:17:53,331 --> 00:17:54,297
I'm not backing off anything.

494
00:17:54,332 --> 00:17:55,698
There's no negotiation,
Harvey,

495
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:57,901
you stay away from
that game tonight

496
00:17:57,936 --> 00:17:59,447
because your services
are no longer needed.

497
00:18:08,271 --> 00:18:09,337
- Louis.
- Steven.

498
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:12,280
I have to say,
I didn't actually think

499
00:18:12,315 --> 00:18:14,126
you'd actually put your money
where your mouth is.

500
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,617
Well, I hope tonight shows

501
00:18:15,652 --> 00:18:16,963
that when I make a promise
to a client, I keep it.

502
00:18:16,987 --> 00:18:19,420
Uh, potential client
but I'll tell you what,

503
00:18:19,456 --> 00:18:21,356
if you can take
my money tonight,

504
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,735
you'll be that much
closer to signing me.

505
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:24,125
Why don't we just have
a seat?

506
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,493
Don't mind if I do.

507
00:18:25,528 --> 00:18:26,961
Harvey,
what are you doing here?

508
00:18:26,997 --> 00:18:28,107
Well, I was in the
neighborhood,

509
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:30,365
I had an extra hundred thou
burning a hole in my pocket

510
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,100
and I thought to myself,

511
00:18:32,135 --> 00:18:34,369
why not show you gentlemen
how to play some cards.

512
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,904
You think you can take
my money?

513
00:18:35,939 --> 00:18:38,773
I don't know,
but I'm sure Louis can't.

514
00:18:38,808 --> 00:18:40,108
You don't mind, do you,
Louis?

515
00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:42,977
Of course not.
I don't mind at all.

516
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:50,048
Katrina, there you are.

517
00:18:50,084 --> 00:18:51,324
I've been looking
all over for--

518
00:18:51,351 --> 00:18:53,618
Before you say anything,
I got you off Hardwick,

519
00:18:53,654 --> 00:18:55,398
but instead of working
in the library tonight,

520
00:18:55,422 --> 00:18:57,456
I think we should work in
the bullpen. It's much--

521
00:18:57,491 --> 00:18:58,935
Katrina,
I can't work tonight at all.

522
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:00,692
What? I just told you
I got you out.

523
00:19:00,727 --> 00:19:02,394
It's not that,
Julie's out of town

524
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:03,929
and we just lost
our babysitter.

525
00:19:03,964 --> 00:19:04,696
Are you kidding me?

526
00:19:04,731 --> 00:19:06,064
We need to do this tonight.

527
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,467
I know, I'm sorry.
She just got sick and I don't--

528
00:19:08,502 --> 00:19:10,268
I get it.
It's not your fault.

529
00:19:10,304 --> 00:19:11,369
I just need your help.

530
00:19:11,405 --> 00:19:14,339
Hey, look,
I know it's not ideal

531
00:19:14,374 --> 00:19:17,242
but we could work
at my place tonight.

532
00:19:17,277 --> 00:19:18,076
Your place?

533
00:19:18,112 --> 00:19:19,511
I don't know what else to do.

534
00:19:20,914 --> 00:19:22,914
Okay, but we need to focus.

535
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,283
Absolutely. 100%.
All business.

536
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:27,063
Once he goes down,
he sleeps through the night.

537
00:19:27,087 --> 00:19:28,353
We can work straight through.

538
00:19:28,388 --> 00:19:29,821
Then what time
should I be there?

539
00:19:29,857 --> 00:19:31,723
8:00. Do you want me
to order food?

540
00:19:31,758 --> 00:19:32,924
No, I think it's best

541
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,270
if we've both eaten
before I get there.

542
00:19:34,294 --> 00:19:35,694
I couldn't agree more.

543
00:19:38,614 --> 00:19:40,447
Raise 10,000.

544
00:19:40,482 --> 00:19:41,615
You're bluffing.

545
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,660
Oh, that's what he does,
Steven.

546
00:19:42,684 --> 00:19:43,950
Not me. Call.

547
00:19:46,088 --> 00:19:48,032
I don't care whether either
of you are bluffing or not,

548
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:49,923
because...

549
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,158
I have a flush.

550
00:19:51,193 --> 00:19:52,359
Oh, shit.

551
00:19:52,394 --> 00:19:53,994
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
not so fast, Steven.

552
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:55,695
I just happen to have
a few queens

553
00:19:55,731 --> 00:19:56,930
reigning over a couple tens.

554
00:19:56,965 --> 00:19:58,799
That's bullshit.

555
00:19:58,834 --> 00:19:59,599
You beat me on the river.

556
00:19:59,635 --> 00:20:00,534
Well, be that as it may,

557
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:02,202
you had a 4% chance
of having a flush.

558
00:20:02,237 --> 00:20:03,670
The pot odds were in my favor.

559
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:06,139
River or not,
I made the right call.

560
00:20:06,175 --> 00:20:06,873
I made the right call.

561
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:09,376
Look, I need a drink.

562
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:11,044
Louis, can I talk to you
for a second?

563
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,479
About what?

564
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:13,658
The fact that I'm beating your
ass in a game

565
00:20:13,682 --> 00:20:14,893
you didn't even think
I knew how to play?

566
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:16,783
You don't know how
to play it, Louis.

567
00:20:17,864 --> 00:20:19,697
Poker's about playing the man

568
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:21,498
and guys like Palmer
don't like to lose.

569
00:20:21,534 --> 00:20:23,312
Oh, please. You don't give
a shit about Palmer.

570
00:20:23,336 --> 00:20:24,668
You're just mad I beat you.

571
00:20:24,704 --> 00:20:26,737
Beat me?
I just had four of a kind.

572
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:29,573
But I laid it down, like I've
been laying down all night,

573
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:31,108
because I'm trying
to let him win.

574
00:20:31,143 --> 00:20:33,143
Bullshit,
you don't let anybody win.

575
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:35,613
I do when I need them
to know I can bend a knee.

576
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:37,459
Well, then why the hell
didn't you bend a knee to me

577
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:39,016
by not coming here
like I asked?

578
00:20:39,051 --> 00:20:40,985
You didn't ask, you ordered.

579
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,888
What you asked was for me
to close this guy

580
00:20:44,322 --> 00:20:45,432
because I'm better
at it than you.

581
00:20:45,456 --> 00:20:46,756
Let me get this straight.

582
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,302
You were going to throw a game
he didn't know you threw

583
00:20:48,326 --> 00:20:49,659
just to prove you
can bend a knee?

584
00:20:49,694 --> 00:20:51,171
He'd know it in his heart
and he'd appreciate it.

585
00:20:51,195 --> 00:20:54,230
I say it out loud,
it humiliates him

586
00:20:54,265 --> 00:20:55,298
like you're doing.

587
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,233
No, Harvey, the person I'm
humiliating is you

588
00:20:57,268 --> 00:20:59,213
because I am closing
the client, taking your money,

589
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:01,003
and you can't stand me
doing either one.

590
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,816
If that's what you think,
then let's get it on.

591
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,607
Because as of this minute,

592
00:21:04,642 --> 00:21:06,742
I don't give a shit
if we land this guy or not.

593
00:21:11,231 --> 00:21:13,732
Hey, how'd it go today?

594
00:21:13,767 --> 00:21:15,512
I thought you said you didn't
want to be involved.

595
00:21:15,536 --> 00:21:16,613
I said I don't want
to be involved,

596
00:21:16,637 --> 00:21:18,270
I didn't say I don't care.

597
00:21:18,305 --> 00:21:21,443
In that case, it went well.
She's good, Alex.

598
00:21:21,444 --> 00:21:24,111
- I know she is.
- Then I have to ask,

599
00:21:24,147 --> 00:21:25,646
why don't you want
to work with her?

600
00:21:25,681 --> 00:21:28,616
All right, the truth,

601
00:21:28,651 --> 00:21:31,252
Rosalie thinks I think
I'm a better lawyer than her.

602
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:32,953
Do you?

603
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:34,433
I wouldn't have married her
if I thought that.

604
00:21:34,457 --> 00:21:36,724
Then why does she think it?

605
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:39,891
We did work together once
back in law school.

606
00:21:39,892 --> 00:21:41,358
- Mock trial?
- Pro Bono.

607
00:21:41,394 --> 00:21:43,560
Something we both cared about.

608
00:21:43,596 --> 00:21:46,563
The case hit a roadblock and
Rosalie suggested one strategy,

609
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,731
I suggested a different one.

610
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:50,167
We ended up getting in
a huge fight,

611
00:21:50,202 --> 00:21:51,569
actually broke us up
for a while.

612
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,536
But you got back together.

613
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:53,970
Because we loved each other,

614
00:21:54,006 --> 00:21:56,840
but we also knew if that kind
of thing happened once...

615
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,475
There's a chance
it could happen again.

616
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,410
Which is why I'm asking
you how it went

617
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:01,478
instead of asking her.

618
00:22:01,513 --> 00:22:03,313
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

619
00:22:03,348 --> 00:22:04,681
the case is in good hands

620
00:22:04,716 --> 00:22:06,683
and the more I get to know you,

621
00:22:06,718 --> 00:22:09,319
I'd say your marriage is
in good hands.

622
00:22:09,354 --> 00:22:11,588
- Goodnight, Samantha.
- Goodnight, Alex.

623
00:22:13,592 --> 00:22:15,926
Okay, Harvey,
it's just you and me now.

624
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:18,562
To tell you the truth,
Louis,

625
00:22:18,597 --> 00:22:20,730
I'm impressed that
you lasted this long.

626
00:22:21,354 --> 00:22:22,998
So why don't you take
your participation trophy

627
00:22:23,022 --> 00:22:24,221
and go home.

628
00:22:24,257 --> 00:22:25,012
The only thing I'll be going
home with tonight

629
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:25,715
is your money.

630
00:22:25,716 --> 00:22:26,826
You two always fight
like this?

631
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,485
Think of it this way, Steven.

632
00:22:28,486 --> 00:22:30,436
If I fight like this
at the table,

633
00:22:30,437 --> 00:22:32,258
imagine how I fight
in a courtroom.

634
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:33,536
Oh Steven, please,
don't listen to him.

635
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,161
The only thing Harvey fights
hardest for is himself.

636
00:22:36,196 --> 00:22:37,395
Raise 50,000.

637
00:22:37,431 --> 00:22:38,897
50 isn't enough.
I'm all in.

638
00:22:41,101 --> 00:22:43,847
Now, Louis, before you decide
how to play the hand

639
00:22:43,848 --> 00:22:45,481
that could clean you out,

640
00:22:45,517 --> 00:22:48,217
I want you to think
of our entire history

641
00:22:48,253 --> 00:22:51,587
of me always winning
and you always losing

642
00:22:51,623 --> 00:22:53,356
and when you finish
doing that,

643
00:22:53,391 --> 00:22:55,403
you'll realize it doesn't
really matter what you do,

644
00:22:55,427 --> 00:22:57,327
because whatever it is,

645
00:22:57,362 --> 00:22:58,995
it's going to be
the wrong decision.

646
00:23:14,398 --> 00:23:15,464
I fold.

647
00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:17,666
See? That's exactly what
I was talking about.

648
00:23:17,701 --> 00:23:19,301
All I had was ten-high.

649
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:24,706
Not only did you lose,

650
00:23:24,741 --> 00:23:27,219
but you have to sit here on
tilt for the rest of the night

651
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,986
while I take the rest
of your money

652
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:32,556
because like I said, poker
isn't about playing the odds.

653
00:23:32,592 --> 00:23:34,325
it's about playing the man.

654
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,027
All I have to say,
that was impressive.

655
00:23:37,063 --> 00:23:39,263
Well, Steven, I didn't beat
him to impress you.

656
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:41,765
I beat him
because that's what I do.

657
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:45,469
I don't follow orders,
I don't bend a knee, I win.

658
00:23:45,504 --> 00:23:47,082
So if that's the kind of lawyer
you want,

659
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:48,839
good luck with your business.

660
00:23:48,874 --> 00:23:51,809
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've got Louis' money to take.

661
00:23:57,075 --> 00:23:59,040
Shit, that woman
was telling the truth.

662
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:02,008
According to Chelsea Conner's
own focus group,

663
00:24:02,044 --> 00:24:05,011
consumers like red,
cursive fonts--

664
00:24:05,047 --> 00:24:06,646
In gold foiled trim,

665
00:24:06,682 --> 00:24:09,558
which means we've officially
got gold foiled nothing.

666
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:10,934
Give me the knock-off group
results again.

667
00:24:10,935 --> 00:24:12,202
Which one?

668
00:24:12,203 --> 00:24:14,484
- What do you mean which one?
- They did, like, two dozen.

669
00:24:14,644 --> 00:24:16,610
Wait a second, how many
focus groups did we do?

670
00:24:16,646 --> 00:24:19,713
- Five.
- Five versus 24?

671
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,215
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

672
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,850
If you're thinking
the only time

673
00:24:22,885 --> 00:24:24,618
someone does that many focus
groups

674
00:24:24,654 --> 00:24:27,848
is when they're trying to rig
the results, then yes, I am.

675
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:29,649
And if we know what
we're looking for,

676
00:24:29,684 --> 00:24:30,783
we know what to do.

677
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:32,719
Which means our work here
is done.

678
00:24:34,189 --> 00:24:35,321
What?

679
00:24:35,356 --> 00:24:37,101
It looks like it doesn't
matter where we work,

680
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:39,092
we make a great team.

681
00:24:39,403 --> 00:24:41,470
That we do.

682
00:24:41,505 --> 00:24:43,839
Great job tonight, Brian.

683
00:24:43,874 --> 00:24:47,776
Good. Focus, effort,
got the job done.

684
00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:50,145
Hey,

685
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,214
just in time.

686
00:24:56,053 --> 00:24:57,386
Hey buddy.

687
00:24:58,989 --> 00:25:02,724
Looks like someone wants
to say hello.

688
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,769
That's okay.
I can say hello from here.

689
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,304
You've never held a baby,
have you?

690
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:11,541
I have--
I've held millions of babies.

691
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:14,010
Well then, I guess you won't
mind holding one more.

692
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:15,378
Okay.

693
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:18,614
How do I do it?

694
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,550
Here.

695
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:23,052
You just take him
in your arms.

696
00:25:23,087 --> 00:25:25,121
- Like this.
- Okay.

697
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,156
Yeah.

698
00:25:37,189 --> 00:25:39,722
I have to go.

699
00:25:47,805 --> 00:25:50,309
Mr. DiBiase, can you explain
why people pay up

700
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,839
to $25,000 a year
to go to your college.

701
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,017
Why does anyone
go to college?

702
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:55,341
To make their lives better.

703
00:25:55,376 --> 00:25:59,104
And you promised their lives
will be better by using lies.

704
00:25:59,105 --> 00:26:01,839
We help our students invest
in their future.

705
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:04,108
By taking on a mountain
of debt and loans,

706
00:26:04,144 --> 00:26:05,321
which your college
profits from

707
00:26:05,345 --> 00:26:06,978
and you profit from personally.

708
00:26:07,013 --> 00:26:09,180
- That is not true.
- Isn't it?

709
00:26:09,215 --> 00:26:12,350
Half your pay is tied
to loan origination, correct?

710
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:15,853
That doesn't mean that
I profit from the loans.

711
00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:17,722
It means that it doesn't
matter

712
00:26:17,757 --> 00:26:19,035
whether students find jobs or
not,

713
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:21,125
as long as bodies
keep coming through that door,

714
00:26:21,161 --> 00:26:22,171
signing their lives away
with debt.

715
00:26:22,195 --> 00:26:24,162
And you're paid to say
whatever it takes

716
00:26:24,197 --> 00:26:25,997
to make that happen,
aren't you?

717
00:26:26,032 --> 00:26:27,109
Don't answer that question.

718
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:28,210
Then I'll answer it for you.

719
00:26:28,234 --> 00:26:30,868
You are paid to do that
and once we prove that,

720
00:26:30,904 --> 00:26:33,805
we can come after
you personally.

721
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,107
- Is that true?
- No it isn't

722
00:26:36,142 --> 00:26:37,909
and even if they do,
we'll indemnify you.

723
00:26:37,944 --> 00:26:41,145
So it's not true, but it
might be true?

724
00:26:41,676 --> 00:26:43,509
Who do you think she's
looking out for, Frank?

725
00:26:43,544 --> 00:26:45,311
You or Logan Tech?

726
00:26:45,346 --> 00:26:47,813
They're going to say you lied
to inflate your compensation--

727
00:26:47,848 --> 00:26:49,515
Then they're gonna
hang you out to dry

728
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,872
and wipe their hands clean.

729
00:26:50,873 --> 00:26:52,673
And this is your one
and only chance,

730
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:54,708
because right now,
we will waive your liability.

731
00:26:54,744 --> 00:26:57,411
You know what?
We're done here.

732
00:26:59,415 --> 00:27:01,115
I lied about the numbers.

733
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,016
And did
the Board of Directors

734
00:27:02,051 --> 00:27:05,085
instruct you
to tell those lies?

735
00:27:05,121 --> 00:27:06,620
They did.

736
00:27:06,656 --> 00:27:09,156
We'll accept a settlement
of $50,000 per plaintiff.

737
00:27:09,191 --> 00:27:11,225
$15,000 and that is
the best you're gonna get.

738
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,438
The best we're gonna get is
if we play that tape in court

739
00:27:13,462 --> 00:27:15,796
and a jury is gonna give us
$100,000.

740
00:27:15,831 --> 00:27:17,509
Well, if you do,
you won't even get 15,000

741
00:27:17,533 --> 00:27:18,866
because we'll be bankrupt

742
00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:20,067
and if you don't believe me,

743
00:27:20,102 --> 00:27:21,635
I'll send over
our books to prove it.

744
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:28,682
Good, you're still here.

745
00:27:28,717 --> 00:27:30,951
Actually, I'm leaving early
because I have plans.

746
00:27:30,986 --> 00:27:32,964
The only plans you have is
to stay here and help me.

747
00:27:32,988 --> 00:27:34,788
Okay, Louis,

748
00:27:34,823 --> 00:27:37,390
if you want my help, I'd start
with "what's so important?"

749
00:27:37,426 --> 00:27:39,426
As usual,
Harvey's out of control.

750
00:27:39,461 --> 00:27:40,638
He lied to me about landing
Steven Palmer,

751
00:27:40,662 --> 00:27:43,530
then defies me by showing up
to his goddamn card game

752
00:27:43,565 --> 00:27:46,533
then he proceeds to humiliate
me and a potential client.

753
00:27:46,568 --> 00:27:48,368
And what do you want me
to do about it?

754
00:27:48,403 --> 00:27:50,281
I want you to do for me what
I know you did for Thomas.

755
00:27:50,305 --> 00:27:52,072
- What?
- Matchmake, Donna.

756
00:27:52,107 --> 00:27:54,052
I want you to stay here
to find me the perfect whale

757
00:27:54,076 --> 00:27:56,600
so I can prove I close
just as well as Harvey can.

758
00:27:56,601 --> 00:27:58,802
Louis, I'm sorry you're in
this situation

759
00:27:58,837 --> 00:28:01,571
and I would be happy to help
you at any other time,

760
00:28:01,606 --> 00:28:04,304
but not tonight because
like I said, I have plans.

761
00:28:04,305 --> 00:28:05,850
Yeah, what,
more drinks with the girls?

762
00:28:05,874 --> 00:28:07,707
It's not a girls night,
it's my night.

763
00:28:07,742 --> 00:28:09,854
You think I wouldn't rather
spend my evening with Sheila?

764
00:28:09,878 --> 00:28:12,645
But I need this, Donna,
and I need it tonight,

765
00:28:12,681 --> 00:28:13,980
and you said
you feel responsible

766
00:28:14,015 --> 00:28:14,947
for me running this firm.

767
00:28:14,983 --> 00:28:17,183
Fine, you want my help?
Here it is.

768
00:28:17,218 --> 00:28:18,785
Instead of trying to prove
to Harvey

769
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,930
that you're a better closer
than he is,

770
00:28:19,954 --> 00:28:22,455
why don't you act like
a grown-up and work it out.

771
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,691
Or don't,
either way I'm going out

772
00:28:24,726 --> 00:28:26,092
because I've earned it.

773
00:28:26,127 --> 00:28:27,760
Donna, I'm giving you
a direct order.

774
00:28:27,796 --> 00:28:31,264
So you can follow it or don't
but if you don't,

775
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:33,110
don't you ever tell me that
you feel responsible

776
00:28:33,134 --> 00:28:34,734
for putting me
in this position again.

777
00:28:40,408 --> 00:28:42,341
- That was amazing!
- You were amazing.

778
00:28:42,377 --> 00:28:44,944
No, you were amazing.

779
00:28:44,979 --> 00:28:46,879
All right, I was.

780
00:28:48,989 --> 00:28:49,999
You know what's
even more amazing

781
00:28:50,023 --> 00:28:52,023
is that we're gonna
get $50,000 per client.

782
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:53,358
You mean $15,000 per client.

783
00:28:53,393 --> 00:28:56,027
No, 50.

784
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,775
Don't tell me you believed that
bullshit about their books.

785
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,732
You bet your ass
I believed it.

786
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:03,142
They're not gonna send over
cooked books.

787
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:05,309
Rosalie, crying poor is
the oldest trick in the book.

788
00:29:05,345 --> 00:29:06,310
Not as old as being poor.

789
00:29:06,346 --> 00:29:08,513
Well, I was poor
and if you ask me,

790
00:29:08,548 --> 00:29:09,947
I'd rather have 50,000
than 15,000.

791
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:11,549
And I'd rather
get them a million,

792
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,129
but that's not the choice
that's on the table.

793
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:14,252
Listen to me,

794
00:29:14,287 --> 00:29:16,865
I know you're excited about
getting an offer

795
00:29:16,866 --> 00:29:18,077
after being out of the ring
for so long--

796
00:29:18,101 --> 00:29:20,568
This isn't about
being out of the ring,

797
00:29:20,603 --> 00:29:22,703
this is about getting money
for my clients.

798
00:29:22,739 --> 00:29:24,742
Well, it's also supposed
to be about getting back

799
00:29:24,743 --> 00:29:27,207
in the game
and building a reputation.

800
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:29,141
And this builds a reputation
for me just fine.

801
00:29:29,176 --> 00:29:30,976
Yeah, as someone
any competent attorney

802
00:29:31,011 --> 00:29:32,578
can eat for breakfast.

803
00:29:32,613 --> 00:29:33,890
Okay, you know what,
I've heard you out,

804
00:29:33,914 --> 00:29:34,821
now you're going
to hear me.

805
00:29:34,822 --> 00:29:36,444
I heard you
and I'm telling you

806
00:29:36,445 --> 00:29:37,999
you are making the wrong call.

807
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,768
Well, I disagree
and I appreciate your help

808
00:29:40,803 --> 00:29:43,704
but this is my case
and we're taking the offer.

809
00:29:46,843 --> 00:29:48,409
Ms. Janowitz,

810
00:29:48,444 --> 00:29:50,377
why did you conduct
two dozen focus groups

811
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,297
before launching your product?

812
00:29:51,298 --> 00:29:53,633
To test the consumers'
response to the product.

813
00:29:53,634 --> 00:29:54,626
Except you weren't
just testing

814
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:56,178
their responses, were you?

815
00:29:56,179 --> 00:29:57,545
You were reshaping them.

816
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,481
Making changes based on
results is the point of a test.

817
00:30:00,517 --> 00:30:02,557
You mean deliberate changes
to make your packaging

818
00:30:02,585 --> 00:30:04,485
look more and more
like our client's.

819
00:30:04,521 --> 00:30:06,688
I already explained this,
women respond--

820
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:09,223
We all know
what women respond to.

821
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:10,325
And you know what?

822
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,560
You gave them exactly
what they were looking for.

823
00:30:12,595 --> 00:30:15,163
You offered a package
they couldn't resist

824
00:30:15,198 --> 00:30:16,297
and that confused them

825
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:19,133
and you can't deny that
you knew what you were doing

826
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:21,026
and how it made them feel.

827
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,560
Is there a question here?

828
00:30:22,595 --> 00:30:23,694
I have a question.

829
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,930
Did you know you were
breaking the rules

830
00:30:25,965 --> 00:30:28,933
by enticing
our loyal customers to stray?

831
00:30:28,968 --> 00:30:29,979
We didn't break any rules.

832
00:30:30,003 --> 00:30:30,935
But you flirted with them.

833
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,937
What someone buys
is their choice.

834
00:30:32,972 --> 00:30:35,239
Except you confused
that choice and as a result

835
00:30:35,275 --> 00:30:37,408
people wanted something
they didn't mean to want,

836
00:30:37,443 --> 00:30:38,554
but couldn't help themselves

837
00:30:38,578 --> 00:30:39,777
That's not true.

838
00:30:39,812 --> 00:30:41,056
Just admit it,
you confused innocent customers

839
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,081
about what they wanted
because you wanted to be

840
00:30:44,117 --> 00:30:45,661
what they wanted
so they would choose you.

841
00:30:45,685 --> 00:30:47,296
But they can't choose you,
they just can't.

842
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,497
No matter how much
they want to

843
00:30:48,521 --> 00:30:50,454
because they've already
chosen someone else.

844
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,256
All right, I don't know
what's going on

845
00:30:52,292 --> 00:30:54,270
between the two of you,
but this deposition is over.

846
00:31:02,957 --> 00:31:05,534
Alex, we need to talk.

847
00:31:05,535 --> 00:31:07,318
No, we do not because
there's only one thing

848
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:08,176
you'd be here to talk about,

849
00:31:08,177 --> 00:31:09,802
and I already told you
I want to stay out of it.

850
00:31:09,803 --> 00:31:10,902
Well before you say that,

851
00:31:10,937 --> 00:31:12,690
you should know Rosalie's
about to make a huge mistake.

852
00:31:12,691 --> 00:31:15,103
What are you talking about?
No, forget I asked that.

853
00:31:15,104 --> 00:31:17,046
Well, you did ask,
we've got them by the throat

854
00:31:17,047 --> 00:31:19,336
but they're saying unless
we take 30¢ on the dollar,

855
00:31:19,337 --> 00:31:20,260
they're gonna go bankrupt.

856
00:31:20,261 --> 00:31:21,372
- What?
- That right there.

857
00:31:21,373 --> 00:31:23,418
You know what I'm getting at,
they're not going bankrupt.

858
00:31:23,442 --> 00:31:25,353
Samantha, I'm not going
to stick my nose in her case.

859
00:31:25,377 --> 00:31:26,448
I'm not asking you
to stick your nose in,

860
00:31:26,449 --> 00:31:27,660
I'm asking
if you think I'm right.

861
00:31:27,684 --> 00:31:28,649
I think I said
I'd say out of it.

862
00:31:28,685 --> 00:31:29,762
Which means you
do agree with me

863
00:31:29,786 --> 00:31:32,019
and all I'm saying is
I think we should counter.

864
00:31:32,055 --> 00:31:33,466
- Then counter.
- I can't, she's first chair.

865
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,134
Well, what do you want me
to do about that?

866
00:31:35,158 --> 00:31:36,936
I want you to tell her
you think my way is better.

867
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,120
God damn it, I don't want
to say whose way is better!

868
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:43,868
Alex,

869
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:45,748
I know you don't want to cause
conflict with your wife,

870
00:31:45,772 --> 00:31:48,739
but you know this is
the right thing to do.

871
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:56,847
Look, I know you kids
eat late these days,

872
00:31:56,883 --> 00:31:58,616
but shouldn't you be going?

873
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:00,496
Maybe, but if I can't figure
something out soon,

874
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,219
I'm gonna have to cancel
with Thomas.

875
00:32:02,255 --> 00:32:03,654
What, why?

876
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,000
'Cause Louis is an asshole
and so is Harvey.

877
00:32:06,001 --> 00:32:08,234
That's not a reason, Donna,
that's just a Tuesday.

878
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,836
I know you're kidding,
Gretchen,

879
00:32:09,871 --> 00:32:10,904
but I don't find it funny

880
00:32:10,939 --> 00:32:12,538
that Louis and Harvey
are in a fight

881
00:32:12,574 --> 00:32:13,973
and it's going
to ruin my night.

882
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:16,075
It's not ruining anything
and whatever it is,

883
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:17,543
it's their problem,
not yours.

884
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:18,779
And that's what I told Louis

885
00:32:18,813 --> 00:32:20,513
but then he threw it
back in my face

886
00:32:20,548 --> 00:32:22,360
that I'm responsible
for him being Managing Partner.

887
00:32:22,384 --> 00:32:24,284
I don't give a goddamn
what he did.

888
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,718
You need to stop telling
yourself

889
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:26,853
that bullshit right now.

890
00:32:26,888 --> 00:32:28,321
- Gretchen, I--
- No!

891
00:32:28,356 --> 00:32:29,700
Now I have seen you
put this firm first

892
00:32:29,724 --> 00:32:31,703
more times than I can count.

893
00:32:31,704 --> 00:32:32,847
What you need to be doing
is heading home,

894
00:32:32,871 --> 00:32:36,606
putting on that dress I know
you laid out this morning.

895
00:32:36,642 --> 00:32:39,142
Okay.

896
00:32:39,178 --> 00:32:40,388
But what about
Louis and Harvey?

897
00:32:40,412 --> 00:32:42,279
You leave those two fools
to me.

898
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:51,684
Robert,
can I talk to you a second?

899
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,796
Of course, Louis,
what's on your mind?

900
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,187
You knew Harvey lied to me
about Steven Palmer,

901
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,589
didn't you?

902
00:32:56,624 --> 00:32:57,556
I did.

903
00:32:57,592 --> 00:32:59,992
Robert...

904
00:33:00,028 --> 00:33:02,795
why didn't you say anything?

905
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,233
Would you have told me if the
shoe was on the other foot?

906
00:33:10,838 --> 00:33:12,538
No, I wouldn't.

907
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:16,675
Now Louis, I obviously
wasn't successful

908
00:33:16,676 --> 00:33:18,109
dealing with Harvey myself.

909
00:33:18,144 --> 00:33:20,178
But from what I know
of the situation,

910
00:33:20,213 --> 00:33:23,381
you stuck your head in
too early and got it bit off.

911
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:24,616
What would you do?

912
00:33:24,651 --> 00:33:27,785
I make a gesture
of holding my other hand out.

913
00:33:27,821 --> 00:33:29,354
You'd really do that?

914
00:33:29,389 --> 00:33:30,733
Probably not,
but I sure wish I would.

915
00:33:30,757 --> 00:33:32,757
And Louis, one more thing.

916
00:33:32,792 --> 00:33:35,293
Harvey wasn't
being disrespectful to you,

917
00:33:35,328 --> 00:33:40,231
he was just treating you the
way he treated Jessica and me.

918
00:33:40,267 --> 00:33:44,099
I get it, he's
an equal opportunity asshole.

919
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,001
Serving the community
24 hours a day.

920
00:33:47,036 --> 00:33:48,802
Thank you, Robert.

921
00:33:48,838 --> 00:33:50,070
You're welcome, Louis.

922
00:33:52,879 --> 00:33:55,180
Baby, I don't know what
that celery did,

923
00:33:55,215 --> 00:33:57,082
but I want you to know,
I'm on your side.

924
00:33:58,652 --> 00:34:01,253
Good, because that stalk right
there just put the moves on me.

925
00:34:03,422 --> 00:34:05,489
Hey,
I've been meaning to ask.

926
00:34:05,524 --> 00:34:07,557
How's it going with your case?

927
00:34:07,593 --> 00:34:09,293
You mean Samantha
didn't tell you?

928
00:34:09,328 --> 00:34:11,395
We got an offer
and it's amazing.

929
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,330
That's great.

930
00:34:13,365 --> 00:34:15,399
How much?

931
00:34:15,434 --> 00:34:17,834
- I don't believe it.
- Believe what?

932
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,314
You think I can't tell when
you're trying to back door

933
00:34:20,315 --> 00:34:22,115
your way into a conversation?

934
00:34:22,565 --> 00:34:24,009
Your mother's 80th birthday
come to mind?

935
00:34:24,033 --> 00:34:25,766
- Rosalie--
- Uh-huh,

936
00:34:25,801 --> 00:34:27,679
Samantha told you and you
agree with her, admit it.

937
00:34:27,703 --> 00:34:28,836
All right, I do

938
00:34:28,871 --> 00:34:30,771
because I've seen people
cook the books before.

939
00:34:30,806 --> 00:34:32,439
Damn it, Alex,

940
00:34:32,475 --> 00:34:34,308
this is exactly what happened
in law school.

941
00:34:34,343 --> 00:34:36,343
You think you know better than
me.

942
00:34:36,848 --> 00:34:39,708
Well, if you don't respect
me as a lawyer,

943
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:40,986
why don't you just tell me
to my face?

944
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,308
Because I do
have faith in you

945
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:44,120
and the only thing that's
the same about law school

946
00:34:44,144 --> 00:34:45,956
is that you don't believe me,
but I do respect you

947
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,290
which is why I'm telling you
to your face

948
00:34:47,314 --> 00:34:48,814
I think you should reject
that deal.

949
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:49,715
It didn't sound like
you were going

950
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,350
to tell me that
to my face.

951
00:34:51,385 --> 00:34:53,196
That's because you have
a chip on your shoulder

952
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,098
that always shows up whenever
we talk about the law,

953
00:34:55,122 --> 00:34:57,089
which is why I didn't want
to get involved

954
00:34:57,124 --> 00:34:59,458
in the first place.

955
00:34:59,493 --> 00:35:01,727
You really respect me
as a lawyer?

956
00:35:03,697 --> 00:35:06,265
I wouldn't have married you
if I didn't.

957
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,577
So can we please put
our guns down

958
00:35:07,601 --> 00:35:08,845
and just forget that
I said anything?

959
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:11,336
No, we can't.

960
00:35:11,372 --> 00:35:12,738
But we can put our guns down.

961
00:35:12,773 --> 00:35:14,306
What do you mean?

962
00:35:14,341 --> 00:35:17,109
I mean, I want
to take you through

963
00:35:17,144 --> 00:35:19,444
why I think I'm making
the right decision.

964
00:35:24,377 --> 00:35:26,244
Gretchen,
what can I do for you?

965
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:27,777
You need to sit your ass down
and listen to me.

966
00:35:27,778 --> 00:35:28,620
Excuse me?

967
00:35:28,621 --> 00:35:30,632
Yeah, I can see you're on
your way to some fancy dinner

968
00:35:30,656 --> 00:35:32,224
or card game
or whatever nonsense

969
00:35:32,225 --> 00:35:33,872
you're spending
your time on these days,

970
00:35:33,873 --> 00:35:35,572
but you need
to turn yourself around

971
00:35:35,573 --> 00:35:36,939
and make things right
with Louis.

972
00:35:36,974 --> 00:35:39,349
I don't need to do anything.
This is between me and Louis.

973
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,283
No, it isn't because
when the two of you

974
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:42,718
get into one of
your death matches,

975
00:35:42,753 --> 00:35:44,453
it puts a burden
on the rest of us

976
00:35:44,488 --> 00:35:46,513
and I, for one,
am tired of it.

977
00:35:46,514 --> 00:35:47,791
Oh, you're tired of it,
are you?

978
00:35:47,815 --> 00:35:49,515
Yes, I am.

979
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,428
Makes me sick the two
of you acting like children

980
00:35:51,452 --> 00:35:54,052
and to think I
was considering retiring

981
00:35:54,088 --> 00:35:55,487
when if I left right now,

982
00:35:55,523 --> 00:35:57,412
the two of you would shit
all over your bunk beds.

983
00:35:57,413 --> 00:35:59,257
- Are you finished?
- Are you gonna make it right?

984
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:01,315
It's a two way street,
Gretchen,

985
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,872
and I'm not the only asshole
in the room.

986
00:36:03,873 --> 00:36:05,873
You're the only one
in the room right now.

987
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:10,009
Okay, I've said my piece.

988
00:36:10,044 --> 00:36:11,977
I would have been gentle,
but sometimes someone

989
00:36:12,013 --> 00:36:13,712
just needs to knock
the shit out of you

990
00:36:13,748 --> 00:36:16,415
and Donna just so happens
to have plans tonight.

991
00:36:20,781 --> 00:36:22,447
Well? Did you talk to her?

992
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:24,294
I did and she's still going
to recommend the deal.

993
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:25,631
God damn it,

994
00:36:25,632 --> 00:36:27,366
that is not what
we talked about.

995
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:29,838
What we talked about was
me telling her what I thought,

996
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,468
which I did,
and then she changed my mind.

997
00:36:32,469 --> 00:36:34,135
Of course she did,

998
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,470
'cause as you've made
very clear,

999
00:36:35,505 --> 00:36:37,305
your relationship is more
important than any client.

1000
00:36:37,306 --> 00:36:38,675
Well, I don't
care who's first chair,

1001
00:36:38,676 --> 00:36:40,175
I am not letting
my clients down.

1002
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:42,431
And I'm not backing Rosalie
because she's my wife,

1003
00:36:42,432 --> 00:36:43,963
I'm doing it because
she's one hell of a lawyer.

1004
00:36:43,964 --> 00:36:45,500
Don't tell me
you're believing that shit

1005
00:36:45,501 --> 00:36:47,545
about Logan Tech going under.
- What I believe is

1006
00:36:47,546 --> 00:36:48,676
you don't know whether
they're lying or not.

1007
00:36:48,677 --> 00:36:50,054
That's why I want
to fight to find out--

1008
00:36:50,078 --> 00:36:52,223
And what happens if you lose
that fight, because you're not

1009
00:36:52,247 --> 00:36:53,758
the only one who knows
what it's like to be poor

1010
00:36:53,782 --> 00:36:55,092
and when you're shaking
the cushions

1011
00:36:55,116 --> 00:36:56,950
for spare change,

1012
00:36:56,985 --> 00:36:58,529
the difference
between 15,000 and nothing

1013
00:36:58,553 --> 00:37:00,553
is a lot bigger than
the one between 15 and 50.

1014
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:02,021
- I won't lose.
- You sure?

1015
00:37:02,057 --> 00:37:03,289
Because you have lost before

1016
00:37:03,325 --> 00:37:05,258
and one of those times was
to me.

1017
00:37:05,293 --> 00:37:09,128
So let it go or don't,

1018
00:37:09,164 --> 00:37:10,263
but I'm backing my wife.

1019
00:37:10,298 --> 00:37:12,966
And one more thing,
you said it yourself,

1020
00:37:13,001 --> 00:37:15,034
this was supposed
to bring us together.

1021
00:37:16,771 --> 00:37:19,672
Fine, I'll let it go.

1022
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:21,449
But that does not mean I agree.

1023
00:37:21,484 --> 00:37:23,017
If it makes you feel any
better,

1024
00:37:23,053 --> 00:37:25,286
if the two of you didn't
team up on this,

1025
00:37:25,322 --> 00:37:27,322
those people would be getting no.

1026
00:37:42,372 --> 00:37:44,639
Hey.

1027
00:37:46,576 --> 00:37:48,543
You ran right out after
the deposition

1028
00:37:48,578 --> 00:37:49,722
and I wanted
to make sure you're--

1029
00:37:49,746 --> 00:37:51,779
I'm not.

1030
00:37:56,219 --> 00:37:59,887
- Katrina--
- Brian, we can't.

1031
00:37:59,923 --> 00:38:02,490
I know.

1032
00:38:02,525 --> 00:38:04,192
It's no one's fault.

1033
00:38:04,227 --> 00:38:06,494
I know.

1034
00:38:06,529 --> 00:38:08,529
What are we gonna do?

1035
00:38:11,868 --> 00:38:14,102
I don't know.

1036
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:19,073
But you can't be
my associate anymore.

1037
00:38:38,511 --> 00:38:39,522
So you're sticking with that,

1038
00:38:39,546 --> 00:38:40,869
your all-time favorite
is Springsteen?

1039
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,456
Are you kidding?

1040
00:38:41,457 --> 00:38:44,118
I mean, in the beginning
it was just me and my garage.

1041
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:45,685
I would sketch designs
on the wall,

1042
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,920
crank the Boss,
and just build.

1043
00:38:47,956 --> 00:38:49,722
Well, looking at your pieces,

1044
00:38:49,758 --> 00:38:51,691
it's obvious you're doing
what you love.

1045
00:38:51,726 --> 00:38:52,959
What about you?

1046
00:38:52,994 --> 00:38:54,460
What about twenty-something
Donna?

1047
00:38:54,496 --> 00:38:55,662
What was she up to?

1048
00:38:55,697 --> 00:38:59,966
Twenty-something Donna
was eating ramen every night

1049
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:04,570
and acting in an off, off,
extra off Broadway production

1050
00:39:04,606 --> 00:39:06,272
of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof."

1051
00:39:06,437 --> 00:39:08,617
Aw, careful Maggie,
your claws are showing.

1052
00:39:08,618 --> 00:39:10,118
You know
"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"?

1053
00:39:10,153 --> 00:39:12,587
Know it? I was Brick.

1054
00:39:12,622 --> 00:39:13,622
In college?

1055
00:39:13,657 --> 00:39:15,623
No, 9th grade,
but it's not the point.

1056
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:17,492
The point is, if I wasn't
so bad at acting,

1057
00:39:18,378 --> 00:39:20,101
I never would've realized
my passion for design.

1058
00:39:20,102 --> 00:39:22,029
Oh, so you're saying
that I was a bad actor

1059
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,596
and that's why
I'm a great COO?

1060
00:39:23,631 --> 00:39:25,175
Well, you certainly
couldn't hide the fact

1061
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,799
that you liked me
when we first met.

1062
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:28,620
Oh-ho-ho, is that really
how you want to play this?

1063
00:39:28,621 --> 00:39:29,681
Well, it doesn't have to be.

1064
00:39:29,682 --> 00:39:31,260
In retrospect,
I probably shouldn't have been.

1065
00:39:31,284 --> 00:39:32,995
You know, is it getting hot
in here or is it...

1066
00:39:35,988 --> 00:39:37,154
See, I knew you liked me.

1067
00:39:38,591 --> 00:39:40,424
I do.

1068
00:39:41,794 --> 00:39:44,795
And I'll tell you something
else,

1069
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:46,230
as you know, I was worried

1070
00:39:46,265 --> 00:39:48,866
about mixing business
with pleasure.

1071
00:39:48,901 --> 00:39:50,434
But?

1072
00:39:50,469 --> 00:39:52,836
I haven't thought
about business all night.

1073
00:39:52,872 --> 00:39:54,271
So it's been all pleasure.

1074
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:57,541
Yeah, it has.

1075
00:39:57,577 --> 00:39:59,343
Me too.

1076
00:39:59,378 --> 00:40:01,579
I mean, do you wanna do
somewhere and get a night cap?

1077
00:40:01,614 --> 00:40:03,280
I'd love that.

1078
00:40:12,884 --> 00:40:14,328
Louis, I've been looking
all over for you.

1079
00:40:14,352 --> 00:40:15,852
I was looking all over
for you too

1080
00:40:15,887 --> 00:40:18,188
and I got thirsty,

1081
00:40:18,223 --> 00:40:20,557
thought I'd make myself
a caffeine-free prunie.

1082
00:40:20,592 --> 00:40:22,058
Do they usually
have caffeine?

1083
00:40:22,093 --> 00:40:23,693
You'd be surprised.

1084
00:40:23,728 --> 00:40:25,628
I don't know how to say it

1085
00:40:25,664 --> 00:40:27,630
so I'm just gonna come out
with it.

1086
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:28,765
I'm sorry.

1087
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,400
I'm sorry too, Harvey.

1088
00:40:30,435 --> 00:40:32,802
I stepped in too early,
I shouldn't have

1089
00:40:32,838 --> 00:40:34,449
and I wish I could say
that I won't do it again

1090
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:37,607
but... I probably will.

1091
00:40:37,642 --> 00:40:38,575
Oh, you definitely will.

1092
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,343
You are right,

1093
00:40:40,378 --> 00:40:42,212
but another thing
I might do again

1094
00:40:42,247 --> 00:40:43,257
is call the client
that I'm trying to sign

1095
00:40:43,281 --> 00:40:44,214
and tell them
to sign with you

1096
00:40:44,249 --> 00:40:45,449
because you are
the best lawyer

1097
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,416
that I have ever worked
with, Harvey,

1098
00:40:46,451 --> 00:40:48,685
and that's never going
to change.

1099
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,053
You called Palmer
and said that?

1100
00:40:50,088 --> 00:40:51,287
I did.

1101
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,957
That's funny because
I called him

1102
00:40:53,992 --> 00:40:55,136
and told him I was
the best lawyer

1103
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,829
you've ever worked with too.

1104
00:40:57,073 --> 00:40:57,872
No, you didn't.

1105
00:40:57,907 --> 00:40:59,473
No, I didn't.

1106
00:40:59,509 --> 00:41:00,975
I told him he should sign
with you

1107
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,910
because there's no lawyer
in this city

1108
00:41:02,946 --> 00:41:05,246
that I'd be more afraid
to go up against than you.

1109
00:41:07,421 --> 00:41:08,520
You think it worked?

1110
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,566
To tell you truth,

1111
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,468
I don't care if we sign Steven
Palmer or not.

1112
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:14,937
We are the two best lawyers in
the city

1113
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:18,273
and that is never going
to change.

1114
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,744
- Thank you, Harvey.
- Thank you, Managing Partner.

1115
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:25,981
Prunie?

1116
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,049
Don't mind if I do.

1117
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:47,069
Well, this is me.

1118
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:50,806
I know.

1119
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:57,346
Wow, they never actually come
that fast when I want them to.

1120
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,648
What can I say,
I got a way with the cabs.

1121
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,884
Thank you Thomas
for an amazing night.

1122
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,819
Donna, I just got to tell ya,

1123
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,054
sometimes you don't know
what you've been missing

1124
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,756
until you have it.

1125
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:09,369
So, look, I don't want to wait
three days to call you

1126
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:11,727
or whatever the rules are.

1127
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:14,163
Can we just skip that?

1128
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,732
Can tomorrow be our three days?

1129
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:21,203
What if we say it's tonight
and you come on up.

1130
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:22,805
I just called a cab.
