00:00:00,061 --> 00:00:01,115
<i>Previously on "Suits"...</i>

2
00:00:01,116 --> 00:00:03,772
As of this morning,
we're merging with Robert Zane.

3
00:00:03,798 --> 00:00:05,262
When I came over,
you said my name

4
00:00:05,263 --> 00:00:06,451
would be the one to go up next.

5
00:00:06,452 --> 00:00:08,439
You have my word.
Your name goes up next.

6
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,267
I threw away my diaphragm.

7
00:00:10,268 --> 00:00:13,179
- You're pulling the goalie?
- Yes, Louis, I am.

8
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,480
I need you to get
Robert Zane's biggest client

9
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:16,957
to sell their
manufacturing division.

10
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:19,451
This is going to determine
who runs the firm.

11
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,031
I need you to come through
for me on this one.

12
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:24,289
Your client is dropping
their manufacturing division,

13
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:25,835
and we can get back to the
business of running this firm

14
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,526
under the direction
of Robert Zane.

15
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,161
You think I can't take
Samantha Wheeler?

16
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,823
I think you said
you'd stay out of it,

17
00:00:30,824 --> 00:00:32,764
and I'm not going to help you
tell your own team

18
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:33,743
that you'll cut them out

19
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:35,576
just to get the better
of Samantha Wheeler.

20
00:00:35,612 --> 00:00:38,012
I did what you asked, and
now I have something to ask.

21
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:39,647
- What's that?
- You know what I want.

22
00:00:39,683 --> 00:00:41,549
- Samantha.
- Robert, I want name partner,

23
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:43,351
and I want it
before the year is out.

24
00:00:43,386 --> 00:00:44,819
You said
that I should come back

25
00:00:44,854 --> 00:00:46,654
when I was ready to admit
that you were right.

26
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,257
Takes a big man
to admit that, Harvey.

27
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:50,758
- My office.
- What about it?

28
00:00:50,794 --> 00:00:52,660
- I want it back.
- Your fearless leader

29
00:00:52,696 --> 00:00:55,129
is happy to comply.

30
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:26,828
- Sheila, what is all this?
- A power breakfast.

31
00:01:26,863 --> 00:01:28,663
And it looks delicious,

32
00:01:28,698 --> 00:01:30,777
but you know I usually like to
eat light in the morning.

33
00:01:30,801 --> 00:01:35,003
Just a bowl of Fiber One, or--
- Oh, I know, Louis.

34
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:38,373
I also know the day
you take control of the firm

35
00:01:38,408 --> 00:01:39,941
is no usual day.

36
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:41,976
Before I take control
of what now?

37
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:44,779
Louis, you just merged,
which means it's time

38
00:01:44,815 --> 00:01:47,449
for a new king
to claim the throne.

39
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:49,662
All right, Sheila, if you're
saying what I think you are,

40
00:01:49,686 --> 00:01:51,653
Harvey's already
managing partner,

41
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:54,030
and Zane's going to fight
to take it from him.

42
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,891
Which sets the table for you
to take it from both of them.

43
00:01:57,892 --> 00:02:01,293
Louis, you're a king.

44
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:05,731
And we should all
be kissing your ring.

45
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:08,100
But, Sheila,
where is all this coming from?

46
00:02:08,136 --> 00:02:10,603
It's coming from the fact
that Harvey left you

47
00:02:10,638 --> 00:02:13,873
to fight off the hordes,
and you did just that

48
00:02:13,908 --> 00:02:16,542
by subjugating the army
of Robert Zane.

49
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:18,444
- I suppose I did.
- No supposing, Louis.

50
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,413
You're a god.
A Viking god.

51
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:23,849
And Viking gods
take what they want.

52
00:02:23,885 --> 00:02:26,285
Now go in there,
and claim what's yours.

53
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,155
I will, but not until
I claim what's also mine--

54
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,073
Not yet.

55
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,676
Let's do it this afternoon,
afterward.

56
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:37,379
Then we can play
"managing partner/secretary."

57
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:38,892
In that case you'd better
be ready to take

58
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,617
a whole lot of dictation.

59
00:02:41,652 --> 00:02:43,886
Oh, I will.
Now go.

60
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:46,756
And return to me a king.
- I know.

61
00:03:08,452 --> 00:03:12,320
- Morning, Robert.
- Harvey, I just got in.

62
00:03:12,356 --> 00:03:16,091
The sign looks good.
- Good, I'm glad you liked it.

63
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:18,260
You ready to do this thing?

64
00:03:18,295 --> 00:03:20,128
If you mean,
am I ready to get back to being

65
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:22,097
a managing partner,
I sure as hell am.

66
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:23,765
Then give me
your John Hancock,

67
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:26,435
I'll get it to Louis,
and you will officially be

68
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,438
the managing partner
by the end of the day.

69
00:03:30,474 --> 00:03:32,708
Harvey Specter?

70
00:03:32,743 --> 00:03:35,377
That's right, this is
my partner, Robert Zane.

71
00:03:35,412 --> 00:03:37,179
My partner and I
were clients of Mike Ross.

72
00:03:37,214 --> 00:03:40,582
We founded Pod Space.
- You must be Max Louden.

73
00:03:40,617 --> 00:03:42,384
How do you know I'm not Nick?

74
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:45,087
Because Mike said if one
of you ever came to see me,

75
00:03:45,122 --> 00:03:46,122
it'd be you.

76
00:03:46,156 --> 00:03:48,957
So why don't you tell me
what the problem is,

77
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:50,258
and I'll get you out of it.

78
00:03:50,294 --> 00:03:52,861
Oh, I hope it's that easy.

79
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:55,130
Nick and I started
another business venture.

80
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:58,166
Raised 100 million to
get the thing off the ground.

81
00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:00,256
I can only account
for 50 of it.

82
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:01,858
Well, when 50 million
is missing,

83
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:03,760
the math adds up
to embezzlement.

84
00:04:03,795 --> 00:04:06,429
I know that, but I'm telling
you, Nick wouldn't do that.

85
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:08,031
Not to me,
and not to the business.

86
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:09,632
Then if he didn't take it,
he got taken.

87
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:11,601
Look, I don't know
what happened.

88
00:04:11,636 --> 00:04:14,270
But what I do know is that if
we can't account for the money,

89
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:16,906
and anyone finds out,
we're not just out of business;

90
00:04:16,942 --> 00:04:19,175
we're in prison.
- Trust me, Max.

91
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:21,244
I'm not going
to let that happen.

92
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,046
Thank you.

93
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:26,692
And, Max,

94
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:29,495
don't tell Nick
you came to me with this.

95
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,365
Well, I wasn't going to, but
do you mind if I ask why not?

96
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:35,101
I don't want him
to know I'm coming.

97
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:41,398
I know you already know this,
but he's either guilty

98
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:42,477
and trying
to pin it on his partner,

99
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:43,300
or it's the other way around.

100
00:04:43,335 --> 00:04:44,835
No way that kid's guilty.

101
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,314
I don't know that,
and neither do you.

102
00:04:46,338 --> 00:04:47,838
I know you're
managing partner,

103
00:04:47,873 --> 00:04:50,407
but you handle your clients,
and I'll handle mine.

104
00:04:50,442 --> 00:04:53,510
Hey, fair enough, but just
to be clear, we just merged.

105
00:04:53,545 --> 00:04:55,645
We need to keep
every client we've got.

106
00:04:55,681 --> 00:04:57,314
Like I said, Robert.

107
00:04:57,349 --> 00:05:00,450
You handle your clients,
I'll handle mine.

108
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,328
I've got an assignment
for you.

109
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:08,130
Oh, good morning, Robert.
You look nice today too.

110
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:09,864
Hey, you get to work on time,

111
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,077
I'll tell you that necklace
is pretty all you want.

112
00:05:11,101 --> 00:05:12,033
Right now, I need you
to look into

113
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:13,309
one of
Harvey Specter's clients.

114
00:05:13,337 --> 00:05:16,104
Let me get this straight.
I just finished tussling

115
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,473
with the guy over sticking my
nose into one of his clients,

116
00:05:18,508 --> 00:05:19,941
and now you want me
to stick my nose

117
00:05:19,977 --> 00:05:21,710
into another one
of his clients?

118
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:24,646
Samantha,
the man needs your help.

119
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:25,992
And besides,
he's already seen the bad.

120
00:05:26,016 --> 00:05:27,160
It's time to show him the good.

121
00:05:27,184 --> 00:05:29,351
And again,
what exactly is the good

122
00:05:29,386 --> 00:05:30,819
of me horning in
on his territory?

123
00:05:30,854 --> 00:05:32,721
The good is for the firm.

124
00:05:32,756 --> 00:05:35,457
He may not see it now,
but he will.

125
00:05:35,492 --> 00:05:38,833
- Okay, give it to me.
- He's got two young bucks.

126
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:40,328
One of them
is up to something shady.

127
00:05:40,364 --> 00:05:42,430
I don't know which one,
but he has a soft spot

128
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:44,099
for the one named Max.

129
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:46,615
If that guy's wrong,
he's not going to see it.

130
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,528
And no matter what, we can't
afford to lose the client,

131
00:05:48,552 --> 00:05:50,819
because we just merged.
- Exactly.

132
00:05:50,855 --> 00:05:52,688
I knew I keep you around
for a reason.

133
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:54,289
That you do.

134
00:05:54,325 --> 00:05:57,059
Now, what's the
"something shady"?

135
00:05:57,094 --> 00:06:00,062
- $50 million is missing.
- Ooh, that sounds fun.

136
00:06:00,097 --> 00:06:01,330
So you're on it?

137
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:02,509
Oh, I'm more
than on it, Robert.

138
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:03,882
I know exactly what to do.

151
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,948
- Samantha Wheeler.
- What gave it away?

152
00:06:47,983 --> 00:06:49,394
Several things,
not the least of which is you

153
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:50,984
ambushing me in my office.

154
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:52,230
Well, it doesn't
have to be an ambush.

155
00:06:52,254 --> 00:06:53,920
It could just be
a friendly howdy-doo.

156
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:55,633
In that case,
let me grab my ten-gallon hat,

157
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:57,124
and help make it that.

158
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,425
You don't need
a ten-gallon hat.

159
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,393
You just need
to sign off on this.

160
00:07:02,097 --> 00:07:03,964
Samantha,
this isn't a howdy-doo.

161
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:05,143
This is
an expense account request

162
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:07,267
three times larger
than anyone else's.

163
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,102
Huh, it was only
two times bigger

164
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:11,004
than anyone else's
at Rand Kaldor Zane.

165
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,405
- Try four times bigger.
- How do you know that?

166
00:07:13,406 --> 00:07:15,473
Because it's my business
to know that.

167
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:18,309
And what I know about this is
that I can't sign off on it.

168
00:07:18,345 --> 00:07:19,944
Is it because
I didn't say please?

169
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,613
It's because
I don't know that it's for.

170
00:07:21,648 --> 00:07:24,346
- It's for me to do my job.
- That isn't very specific.

171
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:26,235
No, it's not,
but it's what I had before,

172
00:07:26,236 --> 00:07:27,154
and it's what I need now.

173
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,287
If you want specifics,
talk to Robert Zane.

174
00:07:29,322 --> 00:07:30,562
But he doesn't
have any, either,

175
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,923
which is how he prefers it.

176
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,359
Well, I'm not Robert.

177
00:07:34,394 --> 00:07:36,861
But since I'm also not trying
to get off on the wrong foot,

178
00:07:36,897 --> 00:07:40,782
I will authorize half of this,
which is the most we give.

179
00:07:40,783 --> 00:07:42,382
I get it.

180
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:44,162
The new girl comes in,
and you want to make sure

181
00:07:44,186 --> 00:07:46,219
she understands
the pecking order.

182
00:07:46,255 --> 00:07:49,022
That wasn't my intention.

183
00:07:49,058 --> 00:07:50,301
But if that's
the way you see it,

184
00:07:50,325 --> 00:07:51,436
that tells me
a lot more about you

185
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,826
than it tells you about me.

186
00:07:54,997 --> 00:07:56,363
Good to finally meet you,
Samantha.

187
00:07:56,398 --> 00:07:58,832
Good to meet you too, Donna.

188
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:06,500
- Harvey, good, you're here.
- I am, but not for long.

189
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:07,433
I have to
take care of something

190
00:08:07,468 --> 00:08:08,612
for one of Mike's old clients.

191
00:08:08,636 --> 00:08:10,620
That's fine,
but I need to talk to you now.

192
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:11,595
You may not like
what I have to say--

193
00:08:11,596 --> 00:08:13,573
Oh, I almost forgot.
Robert and I signed the papers

194
00:08:13,597 --> 00:08:15,405
for him to take over
as managing partner.

195
00:08:15,406 --> 00:08:16,772
They're on my desk.
- You what?

196
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:18,540
I know, I wouldn't
have thought it, either,

197
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:21,009
but as it turns out, I'd rather
not be managing partner.

198
00:08:21,045 --> 00:08:22,589
- That's not what I--
- Hey, Louis, do me a favor.

199
00:08:22,613 --> 00:08:24,391
Sign the papers and drop
them off to Donna, will you?

200
00:08:24,415 --> 00:08:26,682
I think it's important that
we do it as soon as possible

201
00:08:26,717 --> 00:08:28,350
to show Zane the support

202
00:08:28,385 --> 00:08:29,996
that I would have wanted
if it would have been me.

203
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,460
Of course, if it
would have been you.

204
00:08:31,488 --> 00:08:33,789
- Thanks, Louis.
- No problem, Harvey.

205
00:08:33,824 --> 00:08:36,391
I'll get that off to Donna
as soon as I can.

206
00:08:40,393 --> 00:08:42,493
- Nick Turner?
- Yes.

207
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:44,228
- Harvey Specter.
- Mr. Specter.

208
00:08:44,263 --> 00:08:45,663
It's a pleasure meeting you,

209
00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:46,630
but I wasn't aware
we had a meeting.

210
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,733
We don't.
I know we've never met,

211
00:08:48,768 --> 00:08:50,034
but you meant a lot to Mike,

212
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:51,802
which means
you mean a lot to me,

213
00:08:51,838 --> 00:08:53,804
and I just got a proposal
on your behalf.

214
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,474
Smith Barney
wants to take you public.

215
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:58,709
You're kidding.
That's fantastic.

216
00:08:58,745 --> 00:09:00,055
And it's not just
your main business.

217
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:02,847
They want
your new venture too.

218
00:09:02,882 --> 00:09:06,917
I'd love to say yes, but
the new business isn't ready.

219
00:09:06,953 --> 00:09:09,420
Nick, it's not often
you get a top rate

220
00:09:09,455 --> 00:09:12,289
investment bank knocking on the
doors of a fledgling business.

221
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:13,724
But if we do that,

222
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,493
we won't get
the full price of our upside.

223
00:09:15,528 --> 00:09:17,461
What if I told you
they were willing to send over

224
00:09:17,497 --> 00:09:21,098
500,000 in cash
as a good faith advance

225
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:22,700
against any transaction costs?

226
00:09:22,735 --> 00:09:25,636
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- I'm Samantha Wheeler.

227
00:09:25,671 --> 00:09:28,072
I work with Harvey.

228
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:32,376
Like I said,
half a million dollars.

229
00:09:32,411 --> 00:09:34,178
All you have to do
is send your books over

230
00:09:34,213 --> 00:09:35,357
to start the business,
and we'll get down

231
00:09:35,381 --> 00:09:37,515
to making you
and your partner rich.

232
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:41,631
Well, that's very generous,
but as I was just saying

233
00:09:41,632 --> 00:09:43,531
to Harvey, we're already rich,

234
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:45,834
and I don't feel comfortable
giving away our upside--

235
00:09:45,869 --> 00:09:48,570
Nick, don't let this
briefcase get in the way

236
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:50,205
of a great opportunity--
- Look.

237
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,673
I appreciate you both
coming over,

238
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,175
but we're in the middle
of our build out,

239
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:56,578
so please, for right now,

240
00:09:56,613 --> 00:09:58,446
I prefer to keep things
like they are.

241
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:13,490
- What the hell was that?
- That was one cool cucumber

242
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,437
who sounds pretty good,
but couldn't hide the fact

243
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:17,305
that he'd rather cut off his
arm than show us his books.

244
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:19,605
I meant, what were you doing
coming into my meeting?

245
00:10:19,606 --> 00:10:20,939
I was introducing myself,

246
00:10:20,974 --> 00:10:22,707
so we could get off
on a better foot.

247
00:10:22,743 --> 00:10:24,454
I thought you said
we got off on the right foot.

248
00:10:24,478 --> 00:10:25,522
Well, I think so,
but I could tell you didn't.

249
00:10:25,546 --> 00:10:27,079
Well, let me
tell you something.

250
00:10:27,114 --> 00:10:28,558
Derailing my meeting
when it was going

251
00:10:28,582 --> 00:10:29,592
exactly as planned
isn't the way

252
00:10:29,616 --> 00:10:31,485
to get off on a better foot.

253
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:33,186
I don't know what meeting
you were in,

254
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:34,899
but that man was not
going to show you his books.

255
00:10:34,923 --> 00:10:36,856
And offering him a bribe
is going to get him to?

256
00:10:36,892 --> 00:10:39,626
It wasn't a bribe.
It's untraceable cash,

257
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:41,701
which if he were embezzling,
he would have gone for.

258
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,196
We're missing 50 million.

259
00:10:43,231 --> 00:10:45,932
500,000 isn't going to
get him out of his jam.

260
00:10:45,968 --> 00:10:47,634
Well, maybe
if your ex-assistant

261
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:48,846
hadn't hamstrung me
with my expense account,

262
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,203
it would have been more.

263
00:10:50,238 --> 00:10:51,738
Samantha,
you bring Donna into this,

264
00:10:51,773 --> 00:10:53,051
we're never getting
on the right foot.

265
00:10:53,075 --> 00:10:54,040
Look, that wasn't
what I meant. I--

266
00:10:54,076 --> 00:10:55,542
That's enough!

267
00:10:55,577 --> 00:10:56,688
I'm going to get
to the bottom of this,

268
00:10:56,712 --> 00:10:58,678
and I don't need your help,
so why don't you have

269
00:10:58,714 --> 00:11:00,447
some respect
for the chain of command,

270
00:11:00,482 --> 00:11:01,748
and stay away from my clients.

271
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,286
Damn it.

272
00:11:08,657 --> 00:11:10,290
God damn it, what the--

273
00:11:16,465 --> 00:11:18,131
You know I knew that,
don't you?

274
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,644
Of course you did,
you were just testing

275
00:11:19,668 --> 00:11:21,145
the structural integrity
of the machine

276
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:23,370
and the water
and the coffee mug.

277
00:11:23,405 --> 00:11:25,071
- Precisely.
- Listen, Robert.

278
00:11:25,107 --> 00:11:26,906
I didn't come in here
by accident.

279
00:11:27,114 --> 00:11:28,825
I know we were on opposite
sides of the Samantha thing,

280
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:31,750
but I also know you play golf,
and I thought it might be nice

281
00:11:31,785 --> 00:11:33,542
to get out there
and get to know each other.

282
00:11:33,543 --> 00:11:34,742
I think what you really mean

283
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,111
is you'd like to impress
the new managing partner.

284
00:11:37,147 --> 00:11:38,313
And what if I did?

285
00:11:38,348 --> 00:11:40,248
Now let me
tell you something.

286
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:43,550
We get on that course, one of
two things is going to happen.

287
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:44,917
Either you're going
to piss me off

288
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:46,853
by being a scratch golfer,
or you're going to

289
00:11:46,888 --> 00:11:48,421
piss me off
by being worse than me.

290
00:11:48,456 --> 00:11:50,189
What's your point?

291
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:52,592
You want to impress me,
don't do it on a golf course.

292
00:11:52,627 --> 00:11:55,228
Do it with a big, fat client.

293
00:12:04,854 --> 00:12:07,421
- Harvey, we need to talk.
- We sure do.

294
00:12:07,457 --> 00:12:08,750
Did you just give
Samantha Wheeler

295
00:12:08,751 --> 00:12:10,885
the keys to Fort Knox
to use in my case?

296
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,020
No, I refused to give her
an expense account

297
00:12:13,056 --> 00:12:15,856
even bigger than Fort Knox.
Why, what did she do?

298
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:17,391
She tried
to hijack my meeting

299
00:12:17,427 --> 00:12:18,726
with a briefcase full of cash.

300
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:20,461
Let me guess,
you didn't like it,

301
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:22,141
and that's when she said
that she got the money from me.

302
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:24,376
No, she said it would have
worked if you'd given her more.

303
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,566
Which explains
why she went

304
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:27,868
over both of our heads
to Robert.

305
00:12:27,904 --> 00:12:30,377
I don't believe this.
He tripled her expense account.

306
00:12:30,378 --> 00:12:32,832
Yes, he did.
Harvey, we need to figure out

307
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,210
what we're going to do
about this woman.

308
00:12:34,234 --> 00:12:35,278
Well, I'll tell you
what I'm going to do.

309
00:12:35,302 --> 00:12:36,968
I'm going to go tell Robert

310
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:39,137
that if he doesn't
shorten her leash, she's gone.

311
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:41,539
Or you could
extend the olive branch,

312
00:12:41,575 --> 00:12:43,041
and let her
work the case with you.

313
00:12:43,076 --> 00:12:44,554
- And why would I do that?
- Because sometimes,

314
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:46,478
it's best to
keep your friends close,

315
00:12:46,513 --> 00:12:49,414
and the new senior partner we
know nothing about even closer.

316
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:50,526
Well, that's
all well and fine,

317
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,717
but I am tired of
knowing nothing about her.

318
00:12:52,753 --> 00:12:54,219
So am I, so while you're

319
00:12:54,254 --> 00:12:55,653
keeping her distracted
with work,

320
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:57,589
I'm going to go digging
in her medicine cabinet.

321
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:07,132
Sheila, I need
to talk to you.

322
00:13:07,427 --> 00:13:09,120
Louis, you're an hour early.

323
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,854
I hadn't got
my steno pad out yet.

324
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:12,322
- I know, but--
- Oh, my God.

325
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:13,924
You talked to Harvey,
didn't you?

326
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,127
I did, and it turns out
that Harvey's stepping down--

327
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:18,695
And now
you're managing partner.

328
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,598
I knew it! You're even
more of a man than I thought.

329
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:23,500
- Sheila--
- Ah, ah, Mr. Litt.

330
00:13:23,535 --> 00:13:26,403
It's not Sheila anymore.
It's Miss Sazs,

331
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,371
secretary to the
managing partner,

332
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:31,541
and I am ready to be managed.

333
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:34,703
Sheila, as much as I would
love to manage you right now,

334
00:13:34,738 --> 00:13:36,538
now is not
the appropriate time.

335
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:39,808
You're right.
It's not appropriate at all.

336
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:43,578
Just like this isn't,
and this isn't,

337
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:45,513
and this isn't--
- Whoa, Nelly.

338
00:13:45,549 --> 00:13:49,150
Manage me, Louis.
Manage the shit out of me.

339
00:13:49,186 --> 00:13:50,563
Okay, you want me
to manage the shit out of you?

340
00:13:50,587 --> 00:13:52,065
I'm going to manage
the shit out of you.

341
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:53,166
And I'm not just Louis Litt.

342
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,656
I'm--
- A joke.

343
00:13:54,691 --> 00:13:56,624
Look at him, pretending
to be managing partner.

344
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,893
I can't believe he thinks
that we would go for it.

345
00:13:58,929 --> 00:13:59,761
Doesn't he know that
the first three letters

346
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:00,862
of managing is "man"?

347
00:14:00,897 --> 00:14:04,199
Well, at least he's got
the "aging" part down.

348
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:07,002
Speaking of down,
looks like managing partner's

349
00:14:07,037 --> 00:14:08,970
not the only job
he'd underperform.

350
00:14:09,006 --> 00:14:10,939
Louis?

351
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:14,609
- Is something wrong?
- No, nothing.

352
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:18,302
Louis, something's wrong.
You're not at attention.

353
00:14:18,303 --> 00:14:21,716
- I know, I just--I, uh...
- Oh, no, of course.

354
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,493
I should have known.

355
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:25,395
It's the stress
of your new job.

356
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,096
You just became
managing partner,

357
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,499
and you're gone
in the middle of the workday.

358
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:31,667
Yes.

359
00:14:31,888 --> 00:14:34,355
Exactly, that's it.
- Then say no more.

360
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,157
Return to your kingdom.

361
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:38,092
There will be plenty of time
for this later.

362
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:51,663
Oh, good.
You're still here.

363
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:52,965
Wasn't about to be.

364
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,502
What do you say
we both pretend I'm not?

365
00:14:56,537 --> 00:14:58,370
All right, what's going on?

366
00:14:58,406 --> 00:14:59,931
Have you had a run in
with Samantha Wheeler yet?

367
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,633
No, but I take that to mean
one's coming.

368
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,535
The way she operates,
you can bet on it.

369
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,704
- How exactly does she operate?
- However the hell she wants.

370
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,474
- Mm-hmm.
- My feelings exactly.

371
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,276
Which is why I decided
to look into

372
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,578
little Miss "I don't answer
to anyone" myself.

373
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,380
Don't tell me
you came up empty.

374
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,771
Worse, half the people I
asked say she's from Kansas.

375
00:15:18,772 --> 00:15:20,538
The other half, Manhattan.

376
00:15:20,574 --> 00:15:22,485
Somehow, she managed to
graduate from an Ivy League,

377
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:23,686
a state school,
and the Sorbonne

378
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,910
all within the same two years.

379
00:15:24,945 --> 00:15:27,913
One guy even says she's MI6,
but that's "just a hunch."

380
00:15:27,948 --> 00:15:31,683
So you're telling me
that no one has the same story

381
00:15:31,718 --> 00:15:33,451
and we don't know what's what?

382
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:36,288
And since the only person
with more contacts

383
00:15:36,323 --> 00:15:38,556
than me is you, I was hoping

384
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:40,358
you could help me
get some answers.

385
00:15:40,394 --> 00:15:42,894
Then turn around and
get a good night's sleep,

386
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,529
because by tomorrow afternoon,

387
00:15:44,564 --> 00:15:45,942
you'll have all the answers
you need

388
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:48,934
on little Miss James Bond.

389
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:51,436
Do you think we should have a
secret handshake or something?

390
00:15:51,471 --> 00:15:53,939
- Just go.
- Okay.

391
00:15:57,461 --> 00:15:58,694
Louis, what are
you doing here?

392
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:00,496
We don't have
a session scheduled.

393
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:02,731
I'm not here for a session.
I'm here for an erection.

394
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:04,933
- A--A what now?
- I need a prescription, Stan.

395
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:06,635
I don't care if it's
for the blue pill,

396
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,548
or for the one with
the couples in the bathtubs.

397
00:16:08,572 --> 00:16:10,239
I need it now.

398
00:16:10,274 --> 00:16:13,509
Okay, Louis, why don't you
tell me what's going on?

399
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,649
Now that we have merged,

400
00:16:20,684 --> 00:16:23,152
Sheila thinks that I should
become managing partner.

401
00:16:23,187 --> 00:16:25,187
I told her that I would
bring it up to Harvey.

402
00:16:25,222 --> 00:16:27,656
But before I could do that,
he told me that

403
00:16:27,691 --> 00:16:29,869
he had already
handed the firm over to Zane.

404
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,603
And as a result
of telling Sheila that,

405
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:33,138
you are now having
intimacy issues.

406
00:16:33,173 --> 00:16:34,572
As a result
of letting Sheila think

407
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:37,242
that I'm managing partner,
I can't get it up.

408
00:16:37,277 --> 00:16:39,478
Then I must tell you,
a prescription

409
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:41,412
is not going to
solve your problem, Louis.

410
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:42,315
Why not?

411
00:16:42,316 --> 00:16:44,315
Because your issue
isn't blood flow.

412
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,816
It's that you are lying
to Sheila.

413
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:48,352
- Doc.
- Louis.

414
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:50,754
How long are you planning
to hide the fact

415
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,556
that you're not really
managing partner?

416
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:53,669
I don't know,
two to three years?

417
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:55,225
My father convinced my mother

418
00:16:55,261 --> 00:16:56,638
that he was a vice president
for a decade.

419
00:16:56,662 --> 00:16:58,395
It can be done.

420
00:16:58,772 --> 00:17:00,664
Be that as it may,

421
00:17:00,981 --> 00:17:03,048
as I recall,
you accepted Harvey becoming

422
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,683
managing partner
after Jessica left.

423
00:17:04,718 --> 00:17:05,762
That's when I realized
that I didn't want to

424
00:17:05,786 --> 00:17:07,486
become managing partner.

425
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:10,489
Then why are you so reluctant
to tell Sheila that?

426
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:17,095
Because she's always
been attracted to my power.

427
00:17:17,131 --> 00:17:18,375
I tell her that
I don't want to be something

428
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:19,731
that she wants me to be--

429
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:21,533
You're afraid she will
no longer want you.

430
00:17:22,094 --> 00:17:25,095
- I can't lose her again, doc.
- I know, my friend.

431
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,964
But true power
is not pretending

432
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:29,766
to be what you're not.

433
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:31,801
It's admitting the truth
of who you are.

434
00:17:36,797 --> 00:17:38,397
Katrina, you have a minute?

435
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,943
Of course, what can I
do for you, Alex?

436
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:41,812
I was actually hoping
you might be able to help me

437
00:17:41,836 --> 00:17:43,469
narrow down a list.

438
00:17:43,504 --> 00:17:44,815
Seems like that's
my specialty these days.

439
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,906
What kind of list?

440
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,585
These are the clients
who stayed with Rand Kaldor

441
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,820
after the merger.
- That's right.

442
00:17:49,844 --> 00:17:51,443
And I want to know
which one of them

443
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:53,279
Robert Zane would like
to have back the most.

444
00:17:53,314 --> 00:17:54,825
Well, if you want to know
who he'd like to have back

445
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:57,082
the most,
it's Starboard Airlines.

446
00:17:57,118 --> 00:18:00,386
But if you want to know who you
should go after, I'm not sure.

447
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:02,232
Why wouldn't I want to
go after Starboard Airlines?

448
00:18:02,256 --> 00:18:03,534
Because they
used to be represented

449
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:05,891
by Samantha Wheeler.
- I see.

450
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,341
Look, Alex, I don't know
how much you know about her,

451
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:09,687
but I wouldn't
want to pick a fight

452
00:18:09,711 --> 00:18:11,111
with Samantha Wheeler
if it were me.

453
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,557
Well, I appreciate
the warning,

454
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:15,715
but if Starboard's the client
Robert would like,

455
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:17,417
that's the client
I'm going after.

456
00:18:17,453 --> 00:18:18,885
Whether Samantha
likes it or not.

457
00:18:18,921 --> 00:18:21,288
Then I wish you luck,
but do me a favor.

458
00:18:21,323 --> 00:18:22,622
When she finds out about this,

459
00:18:22,658 --> 00:18:24,257
don't tell her
you got it from me.

460
00:18:30,468 --> 00:18:33,302
Thanks, Joe.
Now, you only owe me one.

461
00:18:35,373 --> 00:18:37,306
Harvey.
- Look.

462
00:18:37,342 --> 00:18:40,176
I'm not that big on apologies,
so you're not going to get one.

463
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:42,845
But I thought about it,
and if you're still interested

464
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,858
in working this thing together,
I'm good with that.

465
00:18:44,882 --> 00:18:46,148
Good,
because I found out

466
00:18:46,184 --> 00:18:47,850
some things
you might want to know.

467
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:48,751
You kept working on it,
even after

468
00:18:48,786 --> 00:18:50,720
I told you to stay out of it?

469
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,121
I'm not big
on apologies, either.

470
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:54,023
This is the best
you're going to get.

471
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:55,903
As far as I can tell
from Nick's bank statements,

472
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,561
he doesn't spend shit
on shit; he's clean.

473
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,696
Well, his spending
may be accounted for,

474
00:19:00,732 --> 00:19:03,265
but the original
50 million isn't.

475
00:19:03,301 --> 00:19:05,801
- What are you talking about?
- I can't find any record

476
00:19:05,837 --> 00:19:08,356
of deposits
before the second 50 came in.

477
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:09,990
As far as I can tell,

478
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,926
that 50 covered
the entire cost of the project.

479
00:19:12,962 --> 00:19:16,697
Wait a second.
He didn't need the first 50.

480
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:17,965
He needed the second 50.

481
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,899
And he couldn't
get the second

482
00:19:18,934 --> 00:19:20,701
without saying
he had the first.

483
00:19:20,736 --> 00:19:22,235
Which means
he misrepresented himself

484
00:19:22,271 --> 00:19:24,738
to his investors, and
this is definitely criminal.

485
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:28,108
Shit, we need to go tell Max,
and run through his options.

486
00:19:28,143 --> 00:19:31,156
Harvey, I've fixed
a lot of situations like this.

487
00:19:31,157 --> 00:19:32,423
The first thing we need to do

488
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,158
is go to the guy
that caused the problem.

489
00:19:34,193 --> 00:19:36,193
And give him a chance
to implicate his partner?

490
00:19:36,228 --> 00:19:38,662
No way, we go to the guy
who came to us.

491
00:19:38,698 --> 00:19:40,864
He's our client.
- The business is our client.

492
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,933
And I'm okay with you
working with me on this,

493
00:19:42,969 --> 00:19:46,503
but I am not okay with you
working it against me.

494
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:49,573
Okay, we'll go to Max
first thing in the morning.

495
00:19:49,608 --> 00:19:51,542
I have your word
you'll leave it until tomorrow?

496
00:19:51,577 --> 00:19:53,310
You have my word.

497
00:19:53,346 --> 00:19:55,779
Then let's figure out
how to get them out of this.

498
00:19:58,449 --> 00:20:00,578
So you're telling me
Nick defrauded our investors?

499
00:20:00,661 --> 00:20:03,256
No, Max, I'm telling you
that's what it looks like.

500
00:20:03,257 --> 00:20:04,448
I don't give a shit
what it looks like.

501
00:20:04,449 --> 00:20:06,707
We need to know what it is.
- No, we don't.

502
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,507
Because right now,
it's conjecture.

503
00:20:08,543 --> 00:20:10,609
We prove it,
we have an obligation

504
00:20:10,645 --> 00:20:13,037
to inform your investors.
- So inform them.

505
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:14,950
We do that, your whole
company goes out of business.

506
00:20:14,974 --> 00:20:17,408
And if I keep this a secret,
they'll think I was in on it.

507
00:20:17,443 --> 00:20:19,176
This discussion is over,
I need--

508
00:20:19,211 --> 00:20:21,111
What you need
is to calm down,

509
00:20:21,147 --> 00:20:25,115
and listen to us right now,
because we have a way out.

510
00:20:25,151 --> 00:20:27,251
- What is it?
- According to your contract,

511
00:20:27,286 --> 00:20:29,153
you have the option
to buy out your investors

512
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:31,054
at a 30% return.

513
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,130
They go away happy, and we put
this in our rearview mirror.

514
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:37,765
And assuming we can even come
up with that kind of money,

515
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:39,745
what if someone finds out
before we do?

516
00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:41,624
- No one's going to find--
- That's not an answer.

517
00:20:41,648 --> 00:20:43,515
- Max--
- No.

518
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,617
This is Nick's mistake,
not mine,

519
00:20:45,652 --> 00:20:47,219
and innocent people
go to the police.

520
00:20:47,254 --> 00:20:49,221
Listen to me,
you turn him in,

521
00:20:49,256 --> 00:20:51,223
you'll look like
a guilty man running scared.

522
00:20:51,258 --> 00:20:53,358
- I am scared.
- Max.

523
00:20:53,393 --> 00:20:57,996
You used to trust Mike.
Now I need you to trust me.

524
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,181
We get these guys paid off;
it'll take maybe three days.

525
00:21:01,217 --> 00:21:03,150
Then you're fine.

526
00:21:06,295 --> 00:21:10,364
Okay, Harvey.
I trust you.

527
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,270
Okay, we did it your way.

528
00:21:16,305 --> 00:21:19,573
We talked to Max, and we
presented a united front.

529
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:22,176
You better not be saying
you want to divide it now.

530
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:24,912
All I'm saying
is there's another option.

531
00:21:24,947 --> 00:21:27,679
We replace the fabricated
50 million with a real 50

532
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,211
from an actual investor;
no one will ever know.

533
00:21:30,212 --> 00:21:31,632
Oh, so all we have to do

534
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:33,647
is commit fraud
to get out of fraud?

535
00:21:33,682 --> 00:21:34,716
And how, exactly,
is that any different

536
00:21:34,717 --> 00:21:35,239
from what you want to do?

537
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,172
Because my way
is protected

538
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,774
under the letter of the law.

539
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:40,275
And we have to pay
a 30% return

540
00:21:40,311 --> 00:21:42,010
on something
that isn't worth it.

541
00:21:42,046 --> 00:21:44,546
Keeping Max out of prison
seems worth it to me.

542
00:21:44,582 --> 00:21:45,981
So instead of fighting with me,

543
00:21:46,016 --> 00:21:47,327
why don't you
start thinking about

544
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:48,628
where we're going
to get that money?

545
00:21:56,534 --> 00:21:58,667
Gavin Andrews.

546
00:21:58,703 --> 00:22:01,203
You must be the guy
who wants to be my new lawyer.

547
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,638
I see you like
to cut to the chase.

548
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:03,993
You ever hear the saying
"time is money"?

549
00:22:04,017 --> 00:22:05,350
Well, I got a shitload of one,

550
00:22:05,385 --> 00:22:06,651
because I don't
waste the other.

551
00:22:06,686 --> 00:22:08,286
Then why in God's name
are you wasting

552
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:10,355
either one of them
at a firm like Rand Kaldor?

553
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,168
You really want to kick them
when they're down, don't you?

554
00:22:12,192 --> 00:22:14,359
This isn't about them.
This is about you.

555
00:22:14,394 --> 00:22:17,262
You've got routes under siege.
You've lost gates at LaGuardia.

556
00:22:17,297 --> 00:22:19,075
And if you think Kaldor's idea
of you merging with Delta

557
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:20,532
is the answer to your problems,

558
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:22,667
then you're not the man
I thought you were.

559
00:22:22,702 --> 00:22:24,202
Okay.

560
00:22:24,408 --> 00:22:25,852
You get one case;
you handle it right,

561
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:27,576
you can have my business.

562
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:29,456
I'm not in the habit of
sharing custody of a client.

563
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,280
You're not sharing,
because you're not

564
00:22:31,315 --> 00:22:34,283
officially my lawyer, and it's
not business; it's personal.

565
00:22:34,649 --> 00:22:36,661
You're telling me I handle
a personal issue for you,

566
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:39,419
off the record,
I get your corporate business?

567
00:22:39,454 --> 00:22:41,487
Why would you do that?
- Because I need someone

568
00:22:41,523 --> 00:22:43,356
I can trust to handle both.

569
00:22:43,391 --> 00:22:45,169
Now before you say anything,
if you agree to this,

570
00:22:45,193 --> 00:22:47,627
you're my guy, not some
associate, not another partner.

571
00:22:47,662 --> 00:22:49,696
You.

572
00:22:49,731 --> 00:22:52,665
Okay, I'm in.

573
00:22:52,701 --> 00:22:55,201
And the only thing left for you
to do is tell me what you need.

574
00:22:55,433 --> 00:22:57,567
The truth is, I'm in the
middle of a nasty divorce,

575
00:22:57,602 --> 00:23:00,303
which had led to an even
nastier custody battle.

576
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:02,105
How many kids,
and what are their ages?

577
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,640
Just one.

578
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:05,508
And she's 185 years old.

579
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:15,165
Harvey, I know
you're on your way out,

580
00:23:15,189 --> 00:23:18,423
but you got to see this.
- What is it?

581
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:20,425
I don't believe this.
- What are you going to do?

582
00:23:20,461 --> 00:23:22,194
What I should have done
in the first place.

583
00:23:22,229 --> 00:23:26,932
Kick Samantha Wheeler
the hell off this case.

584
00:23:27,596 --> 00:23:29,730
What the hell did you do?

585
00:23:29,765 --> 00:23:32,999
- I take it Max called you?
- No, he sent Donna a letter

586
00:23:33,035 --> 00:23:36,203
formalizing Nick Turner's
transition to CEO

587
00:23:36,238 --> 00:23:37,816
since Max is suddenly
leaving the company.

588
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,840
Actually, he's stepping down

589
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,375
to spend more time
with his family.

590
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,310
I don't give a shit
what he's doing.

591
00:23:43,345 --> 00:23:45,712
I want to know what you did.
- I did what you wouldn't do.

592
00:23:45,748 --> 00:23:47,681
Protect the client.
- Bullshit.

593
00:23:47,716 --> 00:23:50,384
Max agreed to exercise
the buyout clause.

594
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:54,020
And yet, he still contacted
a criminal defense attorney.

595
00:23:54,056 --> 00:23:55,889
- What?
- He panicked,

596
00:23:55,924 --> 00:23:57,102
and he wasn't
going to keep his mouth shut,

597
00:23:57,126 --> 00:23:59,426
and our client was
going to go out of business.

598
00:23:59,461 --> 00:24:02,028
So you felt the answer
was forcing him out?

599
00:24:02,064 --> 00:24:05,198
The answer was and always is
protect the company.

600
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:08,254
And the fact that you were
more focused on protecting Max

601
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,089
than our client
is exactly why Robert

602
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,569
wanted me to get involved
in the first place.

603
00:24:11,593 --> 00:24:13,226
What?

604
00:24:13,261 --> 00:24:15,562
I wasn't trying to
make things better with you.

605
00:24:15,597 --> 00:24:19,465
He wanted me
to keep an eye on you.

606
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:22,005
You had no right

607
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,640
to force that kid
out of his own company.

608
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:26,576
- I didn't force him out.
- Save your bullshit.

609
00:24:26,612 --> 00:24:27,789
You gave me your word
that you weren't going to be

610
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:29,179
pulling something like this,

611
00:24:29,214 --> 00:24:31,014
so stay the hell away
from my client,

612
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:33,817
or the next time you
make a move behind my back,

613
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:36,586
you'll be finding yourself
another job.

614
00:24:41,401 --> 00:24:46,071
Oh, there he is.
How was your day, my king?

615
00:24:46,106 --> 00:24:48,006
Not great, actually.

616
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:50,842
Well, maybe I can
release your stress.

617
00:24:50,878 --> 00:24:53,879
Sheila, wait.
We need to talk.

618
00:24:53,914 --> 00:24:55,547
Oh, shoot,
you've had a hard day.

619
00:24:55,582 --> 00:24:57,716
We can talk later.
Right now is--

620
00:24:57,751 --> 00:24:59,751
I'm not managing partner.

621
00:25:02,656 --> 00:25:04,089
What?

622
00:25:04,124 --> 00:25:05,624
I went to Harvey,
like I said.

623
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:07,425
Before I could
get the words out,

624
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:09,339
he said that he had already
offered the job to Robert.

625
00:25:09,363 --> 00:25:12,297
Well, what happened when you
told him you wanted the job?

626
00:25:12,332 --> 00:25:15,033
I didn't say
I wanted the job.

627
00:25:15,068 --> 00:25:19,171
Wait, so instead of fighting
for what you want,

628
00:25:19,206 --> 00:25:21,952
you decided to lie to me
about getting it?

629
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,587
- Oh, Sheila, that's not fair.
- How could you lie to me?

630
00:25:24,622 --> 00:25:26,889
I didn't. I came here
to tell you the truth.

631
00:25:26,924 --> 00:25:28,402
But you thought
I already had the job,

632
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:29,603
and you seemed
so excited about it.

633
00:25:29,627 --> 00:25:31,427
Oh, my God.

634
00:25:31,462 --> 00:25:33,629
That's why you couldn't
have sex, isn't it?

635
00:25:33,664 --> 00:25:36,165
Yes.

636
00:25:36,815 --> 00:25:39,049
Yes, so I went to
Dr. Lipschitz to talk about it,

637
00:25:39,084 --> 00:25:40,717
and you know what he told me?

638
00:25:40,753 --> 00:25:43,720
He told me that I should trust
that you love me

639
00:25:43,756 --> 00:25:45,522
and that I can
tell you the truth.

640
00:25:45,557 --> 00:25:47,724
And I think instead
of letting your therapist

641
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,493
convince you to
give up your dream,

642
00:25:49,528 --> 00:25:51,928
maybe you should have marched
back into Harvey's office

643
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:53,341
to take what's yours.
- Sheila, please.

644
00:25:53,365 --> 00:25:54,631
I'm not giving up anything.

645
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:56,733
I don't want to be
managing partner.

646
00:25:56,769 --> 00:25:59,469
And now you're not
only lying to me,

647
00:25:59,505 --> 00:26:03,440
you're lying to yourself.
- No, I'm not.

648
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:07,544
I don't want managing partner,
and you said you love me.

649
00:26:08,153 --> 00:26:10,053
Well, this is who I am,

650
00:26:10,089 --> 00:26:13,123
and you can either accept that
or not, but it's not changing.

651
00:26:22,128 --> 00:26:24,524
And it's understandable
for you

652
00:26:24,525 --> 00:26:26,334
to be concerned about your
brother.

653
00:26:26,703 --> 00:26:28,436
But...

654
00:26:28,472 --> 00:26:32,207
why do you believe
he's lying to himself?

655
00:26:32,794 --> 00:26:34,861
Because I know my brother,

656
00:26:34,896 --> 00:26:37,096
and I know he wanted
that promotion.

657
00:26:37,132 --> 00:26:39,666
And I can't stand seeing him
not go after it,

658
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:43,136
just because some crackpot
undermined his confidence.

659
00:26:43,171 --> 00:26:46,139
And who exactly is this--
this crackpot?

660
00:26:46,174 --> 00:26:50,910
I'll tell you who it is.
It's his...mother.

661
00:26:51,134 --> 00:26:53,534
Uh, forgive me,
but wouldn't you refer

662
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:54,835
to his mother as your mother?

663
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:58,506
Well, yes, but...

664
00:26:58,541 --> 00:26:59,818
Well, this isn't about me,
I'm trying to--

665
00:26:59,842 --> 00:27:02,376
Oh, my God, you're Sheila.

666
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,889
I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

667
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,780
I'm sorry, but I told you
on the phone.

668
00:27:05,815 --> 00:27:07,793
It is unethical for me to see
you without Louis' permission.

669
00:27:07,817 --> 00:27:09,750
I could care less
about your ethics.

670
00:27:09,786 --> 00:27:12,620
- Excuse me?
- Cut the bullshit, Lipschitz.

671
00:27:12,655 --> 00:27:15,423
Louis came to see you after
Zane got managing partner,

672
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:18,220
and instead of encouraging him
to take it back,

673
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:20,855
you undermined his confidence.
- Hm.

674
00:27:24,194 --> 00:27:26,694
It's interesting
that you think I'm the one

675
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,397
undermining his confidence,
because the only times

676
00:27:29,432 --> 00:27:31,666
in his life that Louis
has been unable to perform

677
00:27:31,701 --> 00:27:34,702
have been with you,
including most recently

678
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:36,503
when he went to tell you
the truth and couldn't

679
00:27:36,504 --> 00:27:39,005
because he was afraid
of how you might view him.

680
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,560
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

681
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:44,130
It means, as well
as you think you know him,

682
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:45,765
he may know you even better.

683
00:27:45,801 --> 00:27:48,835
Because Louis does not
want to be managing partner.

684
00:27:48,871 --> 00:27:50,170
And rather than believe him,

685
00:27:50,205 --> 00:27:54,007
you can only see
his admission as cowardice.

686
00:27:56,445 --> 00:27:59,880
But I don't understand.

687
00:27:59,915 --> 00:28:01,414
He wanted
managing partner once.

688
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,527
Why would he
change his mind now?

689
00:28:02,551 --> 00:28:06,920
Because people
are not set in stone.

690
00:28:06,955 --> 00:28:11,424
And I suspect
something has replaced

691
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,994
managing partner
as his heart's desire.

692
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:16,062
- A baby.
- No, Sheila.

693
00:28:16,098 --> 00:28:17,831
Love.

694
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:20,534
And I don't think
you need me to tell you

695
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:24,471
Louis Litt would do anything
to not lose the woman he loves.

696
00:28:29,631 --> 00:28:32,265
You know, I had heard about
the legendary Donna Paulson

697
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,901
long before I even got here.
- Oh, that's interesting.

698
00:28:34,936 --> 00:28:36,769
Because I've never
heard of you.

699
00:28:36,805 --> 00:28:38,749
Because that's how I want it,
but you want to be known.

700
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:40,606
And I got to tell you,

701
00:28:40,642 --> 00:28:44,310
the reality is a lot more
disappointing than the legend.

702
00:28:44,346 --> 00:28:46,512
- Excuse me?
- I had a run-in with Harvey

703
00:28:46,548 --> 00:28:48,448
because you went running
to him about Max.

704
00:28:48,483 --> 00:28:49,860
You're damn right I did,
he deserves to know

705
00:28:49,884 --> 00:28:51,651
when someone's
operating behind his back.

706
00:28:51,686 --> 00:28:52,652
And I deserve the chance
to tell him

707
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:54,687
what's going on to his face.

708
00:28:54,723 --> 00:28:56,067
Oh, so you're upset because
I beat you to the punch?

709
00:28:56,091 --> 00:28:58,725
I'm upset because
if you have any issue with me,

710
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,893
you should come to me
and not go around me.

711
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:01,627
Like how you
went around me to Robert

712
00:29:01,663 --> 00:29:03,396
for your expense account?

713
00:29:03,431 --> 00:29:05,204
So that's what
this is really about.

714
00:29:05,205 --> 00:29:07,772
No, this is about
your behavior with Harvey

715
00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:10,141
and Alex and me
and about 100 other things

716
00:29:10,177 --> 00:29:11,220
that all tell me
you don't care about

717
00:29:11,244 --> 00:29:13,011
anyone here but yourself.

718
00:29:13,046 --> 00:29:14,757
If you really think that,
you know nothing about me,

719
00:29:14,781 --> 00:29:16,681
and I'll tell you
something else.

720
00:29:16,717 --> 00:29:20,652
Secretly digging into me isn't
gonna answer your questions.

721
00:29:20,687 --> 00:29:23,028
Yeah, I know you've been
doing that too.

722
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:24,361
And I wouldn't have to

723
00:29:24,397 --> 00:29:25,908
if you'd been upfront
about who you are.

724
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:27,309
You want to know
something about me?

725
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,111
You go ahead and ask.
- And how should I trust

726
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:30,568
that I'd get a straight answer?

727
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,903
Because I am on
this team now,

728
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:34,249
and whether
you believe it or not,

729
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,774
I've got its
best interests at heart.

730
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,842
Well, you got a funny way
of showing it.

731
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:41,078
Because from where I stand,
Harvey is the firm,

732
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,647
and you don't seem to
have his back at all.

733
00:29:56,005 --> 00:29:57,672
Are you enjoying the ballet?

734
00:29:57,707 --> 00:29:59,974
I most certainly am,
and how about yourself?

735
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:01,542
To tell you the truth,
Mrs. Andrews,

736
00:30:01,578 --> 00:30:02,588
I wouldn't be less entertained

737
00:30:02,612 --> 00:30:04,545
if this were
a second grade musical.

738
00:30:04,581 --> 00:30:06,314
Who are you,
and what are you doing here?

739
00:30:06,349 --> 00:30:07,815
I'm here on behalf
of your husband.

740
00:30:07,851 --> 00:30:09,650
Then you can turn around,
and walk right out

741
00:30:09,686 --> 00:30:12,253
because you can't contact me
without my attorneys present.

742
00:30:12,288 --> 00:30:15,323
And that would be true, if I
was his lawyer, but I'm not.

743
00:30:15,654 --> 00:30:19,059
And what exactly did my
soon-to-be ex-husband tell you?

744
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,693
That whatever issues you had

745
00:30:20,728 --> 00:30:22,928
led you to take
his prized Renoir and loan it

746
00:30:22,964 --> 00:30:25,765
to the Met for the sole purpose
of infuriating him.

747
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,667
He's lucky I didn't
burn the damn thing.

748
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:30,670
All the same, I'm here to
convince you to take it back.

749
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:33,639
Now, what will it take
to get you to join the team?

750
00:30:35,984 --> 00:30:38,284
The Villa in Bordeaux,
free and clear.

751
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:40,853
And I never want to worry
about covering the taxes.

752
00:30:40,889 --> 00:30:43,022
- That's a big ask.
- And it's an expensive

753
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:44,824
painting that I have
no interest in,

754
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:46,904
and he can't get back
without looking like an asshole

755
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,029
to the kind of people
he wants to do business with.

756
00:30:50,469 --> 00:30:51,868
What?

757
00:30:51,903 --> 00:30:53,214
I can see
why you don't really care

758
00:30:53,238 --> 00:30:54,804
if your lawyers
are here or not.

759
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,606
So we have a deal?

760
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:03,961
We need to talk.

761
00:31:03,997 --> 00:31:05,596
Don't tell me
Harvey came to you.

762
00:31:05,632 --> 00:31:08,161
- He sure did.
- What exactly did he say?

763
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,096
I'm not here to talk about
what he said.

764
00:31:11,131 --> 00:31:13,031
I'm here to talk about
what you're doing.

765
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:15,100
I'm doing what you
asked me to do.

766
00:31:15,135 --> 00:31:17,869
I asked you to help the man,
not piss him off.

767
00:31:17,905 --> 00:31:19,338
You asked me
to save the client.

768
00:31:19,373 --> 00:31:20,639
This is what
it's going to take,

769
00:31:20,674 --> 00:31:22,908
and since when do you care
if I piss someone off?

770
00:31:22,943 --> 00:31:24,521
Since you made me promise
to put your name

771
00:31:24,545 --> 00:31:25,545
up on that wall next.

772
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:26,878
Because if you do this,

773
00:31:26,914 --> 00:31:28,614
Harvey's going to do
anything he can

774
00:31:28,649 --> 00:31:30,947
to stop your name from ever
going up on that wall.

775
00:31:30,948 --> 00:31:32,747
You asked me
to do it, Robert.

776
00:31:32,783 --> 00:31:35,984
I can't take it back.
What do you want me to do now?

777
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,853
Show Harvey
what I see in you.

778
00:31:38,889 --> 00:31:42,457
Whatever happens along the way,
when push comes to shove,

779
00:31:42,492 --> 00:31:44,826
you will never let him down.

780
00:31:56,386 --> 00:31:58,052
Am I interrupting?

781
00:31:58,087 --> 00:31:59,754
Sheila, what are you
doing here?

782
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:02,657
Well, I realized, that, um...

783
00:32:02,692 --> 00:32:06,093
that you've been to
my office a lot recently,

784
00:32:06,129 --> 00:32:09,764
but I haven't come to yours
in a long time.

785
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:13,100
Well, I know it's not
the office that you, uh...

786
00:32:13,136 --> 00:32:14,502
wanted for me.

787
00:32:14,537 --> 00:32:17,538
It's the
perfect office, Louis.

788
00:32:17,574 --> 00:32:21,943
And you are the perfect man.

789
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:24,200
And I'm sorry
if I made you feel

790
00:32:24,235 --> 00:32:26,669
like I ever
thought differently.

791
00:32:26,704 --> 00:32:28,137
So you don't think I'm weak

792
00:32:28,173 --> 00:32:29,872
for not wanting
to be managing partner?

793
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:32,542
No, I don't.

794
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:33,910
And the reason I got so upset

795
00:32:33,945 --> 00:32:35,812
wasn't because
I think you're weak.

796
00:32:35,847 --> 00:32:38,681
It's that I thought
Harvey and Robert Zane

797
00:32:38,716 --> 00:32:42,452
didn't even value you enough
to hear you out.

798
00:32:42,931 --> 00:32:44,108
- No, they didn't.
- And on top of that,

799
00:32:44,132 --> 00:32:46,299
you were so excited to go
in there and make your case.

800
00:32:46,334 --> 00:32:49,903
- Yes, I was.
- So what happened?

801
00:32:49,938 --> 00:32:54,140
- I went in to see Harvey.
- And what?

802
00:32:54,175 --> 00:32:56,676
He didn't even give me
the goddamn time of day.

803
00:32:56,711 --> 00:32:58,678
Okay, Louis, I'm not trying
to get you worked up.

804
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,154
Because I'm telling you,
I don't need you

805
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:01,844
to be managing partner.

806
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:02,990
No, and I don't need it
either, but what I do need

807
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:04,947
is to be given
the common courtesy

808
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:06,682
of being treated like an equal.

809
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09,752
So what are you going to do?

810
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:11,065
Well, the first thing
I'm going to do

811
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:11,821
is go home right now
and do what I

812
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:13,989
couldn't do the other day.

813
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:16,592
Then tomorrow, first thing, I'm
going to go tell Robert Zane

814
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,462
and Harvey Specter that there
are three names on that wall,

815
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,264
and one of them deserves
some goddamn respect.

816
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,868
Okay.

817
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:29,271
I got your mysterious message
about meeting in here.

818
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:31,207
What's going on?

819
00:33:31,813 --> 00:33:33,780
Did you find something out
about Samantha?

820
00:33:33,815 --> 00:33:35,748
- She did.
- What are you doing here?

821
00:33:35,784 --> 00:33:37,232
She's here because like you,

822
00:33:37,233 --> 00:33:40,000
I got a lot of
conflicting information.

823
00:33:40,036 --> 00:33:41,079
She's the only person I know

824
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:45,072
that's had direct experience
with Samantha.

825
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,707
Well?

826
00:33:46,742 --> 00:33:49,143
People either love her
or are afraid of her.

827
00:33:49,178 --> 00:33:51,123
But anyone who's ever used her
says the same thing.

828
00:33:51,147 --> 00:33:53,113
She is as good as they come.

829
00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:55,849
And when the chips are down,
you want her in your corner.

830
00:33:55,885 --> 00:33:58,118
Do you think
she's in our corner?

831
00:33:58,154 --> 00:34:00,020
I guess that depends
on whether or not

832
00:34:00,056 --> 00:34:02,322
Robert and Harvey
are in the same corner.

833
00:34:16,735 --> 00:34:17,896
I know you're
not in the mood.

834
00:34:18,304 --> 00:34:20,385
I just want to explain what
happened with Max Louden.

835
00:34:20,511 --> 00:34:22,147
I know what happened.
You blackmailed him.

836
00:34:22,148 --> 00:34:25,583
- I did not blackmail him.
- Then what did you do?

837
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:28,386
I asked myself, how the hell
did Nick pull this shit

838
00:34:28,421 --> 00:34:31,022
on Max in the first place?
He's not an idiot.

839
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:32,637
He must have been distracted.

840
00:34:32,672 --> 00:34:34,172
What difference
does that make?

841
00:34:34,207 --> 00:34:36,140
The difference is,
Max was distracted

842
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:38,376
with his sister
who has cancer.

843
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:40,545
So I pulled some strings,
got her into a trial,

844
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,914
and he was more than happy
to step down.

845
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:46,084
Okay, so you didn't
boot him out the way I thought.

846
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:47,452
What's going
to stop Nick Turner

847
00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:49,320
from putting us
in this position again?

848
00:34:49,356 --> 00:34:50,566
What would have
stopped him your way?

849
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,223
Max would've.

850
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:54,792
That was the reason
I wanted to back him.

851
00:34:54,828 --> 00:34:58,262
Well, this isn't Max,
but maybe it will do.

852
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,827
Let me guess, you want to be
the one to do it.

853
00:35:06,862 --> 00:35:09,897
No, I don't.
He's your client; you do it.

854
00:35:09,932 --> 00:35:11,965
Unless, of course,
you need me to hold your hand.

855
00:35:13,702 --> 00:35:15,769
I'm pretty sure I can
take care of this myself.

856
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,541
This is nice work, Samantha.

857
00:35:22,711 --> 00:35:24,711
I just want to be
part of the team.

858
00:35:28,117 --> 00:35:30,984
You know, the place is really
starting to come together.

859
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,487
Doesn't look any different
than the last time you saw it.

860
00:35:33,522 --> 00:35:36,123
I know, I just figured
you're a bullshit artist,

861
00:35:36,158 --> 00:35:37,925
so you'd probably appreciate

862
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,027
a little smoke
blown up your ass.

863
00:35:40,654 --> 00:35:42,854
- Excuse me?
- Okay, have it your way.

864
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,768
We'll cut the bullshit
and get to the part where you

865
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:47,325
defrauded your investors
to pay for this place.

866
00:35:47,361 --> 00:35:48,671
- I didn't--
- And before you even

867
00:35:48,695 --> 00:35:50,629
lie to me about it,

868
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:53,365
why don't you start thanking me
for getting you out of it?

869
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,500
- You got me new funding?
- I did.

870
00:35:55,536 --> 00:35:57,569
Of course, to do that,
I had to let the bank in

871
00:35:57,604 --> 00:36:00,605
on your IPO plans.
- I don't have any IPO plans.

872
00:36:00,641 --> 00:36:03,108
You do now.

873
00:36:03,143 --> 00:36:05,277
I get it.

874
00:36:05,312 --> 00:36:06,890
Once we're publicly traded,
I'll have a board of directors,

875
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,214
and they'll have
full access to my books.

876
00:36:09,249 --> 00:36:11,327
Which means I hope you
enjoyed breaking the law once,

877
00:36:11,351 --> 00:36:13,919
because it's never
going to happen again.

878
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:16,354
And what if I say no,
and then I fire you?

879
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,190
Well, then you
end up in prison,

880
00:36:18,225 --> 00:36:22,017
which happens 99% of the time
in cases like this anyway.

881
00:36:22,018 --> 00:36:23,359
What happens the other
1% of the time?

882
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,295
You're looking at him.
And trust me, Nick.

883
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:29,398
A guy who can do what I did,
you want him on your team.

884
00:36:33,971 --> 00:36:36,004
I'll be in touch.

885
00:36:41,488 --> 00:36:44,823
Harvey, you look like the cat
that ate the canary.

886
00:36:44,858 --> 00:36:47,025
More like the man
who took care of business.

887
00:36:47,061 --> 00:36:49,494
- So you got it done?
- Samantha got it done.

888
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,930
- Does that mean we're good?
- It means the next time

889
00:36:51,965 --> 00:36:53,576
you're worried
about how I handle my clients,

890
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,734
tell me to my face.

891
00:36:55,769 --> 00:36:57,369
Fair enough.

892
00:36:57,404 --> 00:36:59,471
And how about Samantha?
You good with her?

893
00:36:59,506 --> 00:37:02,140
I wouldn't go throwing
a ticker tape parade just yet,

894
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:06,211
but yeah, I admit, I'm starting
to see what you see in her.

895
00:37:06,246 --> 00:37:08,480
Well, that's all
I was hoping for.

896
00:37:08,515 --> 00:37:11,483
Which means now, I can tell you
why I was hoping it.

897
00:37:11,518 --> 00:37:16,083
What's going on?
What haven't you told me?

898
00:37:16,084 --> 00:37:18,418
That her name
goes up on the wall next.

899
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:21,421
And before you say anything,
I gave her my word.

900
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:22,922
- Listen, Robert--
- Whatever it is

901
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:24,769
you're about to say,
it's going to have to wait,

902
00:37:24,793 --> 00:37:26,237
because the three of us are
going to have a little talk

903
00:37:26,261 --> 00:37:27,827
about something
right the hell now.

904
00:37:27,862 --> 00:37:29,707
- What's going on, Louis?
- I'll tell you what it is.

905
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:32,409
The two of you decided
who's running this firm

906
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,043
without including me
in the conversation.

907
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,312
What are you talking about?
You signed the agreement.

908
00:37:36,348 --> 00:37:37,280
The agreement
that you drew up,

909
00:37:37,315 --> 00:37:39,315
and just expected me
to be okay with.

910
00:37:39,351 --> 00:37:40,862
You're saying that you
want to be managing partner?

911
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:42,252
No, Robbie.

912
00:37:42,287 --> 00:37:45,221
But you wouldn't know that,
because you never asked,

913
00:37:45,257 --> 00:37:47,090
and I will not
be the third wheel

914
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:49,025
just because
my name comes last.

915
00:37:49,026 --> 00:37:51,102
No one thinks of you
as a third wheel, Louis.

916
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:52,769
Oh, really?

917
00:37:52,805 --> 00:37:54,649
Because you wouldn't be here
if it weren't for me,

918
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:58,308
and you wouldn't have a firm
at all if it weren't for me.

919
00:37:58,344 --> 00:38:00,377
I saved both
your fucking asses,

920
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:02,212
and not only didn't
you think to thank me,

921
00:38:02,248 --> 00:38:06,149
as far as I can tell, you
didn't even clock what I did.

922
00:38:06,185 --> 00:38:08,085
Now, I am a partner
just as much as you,

923
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,721
and I am done
having to remind you of that.

924
00:38:10,756 --> 00:38:13,323
So the next time there's
a decision to be made, guys,

925
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,559
you better pull up
a seat for me at that table,

926
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:19,396
or I swear to God, I will break
the whole goddamn thing in two.

927
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:21,632
Any questions?

928
00:38:22,589 --> 00:38:24,522
No, Louis, no questions.

929
00:38:25,879 --> 00:38:28,126
Good.

930
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:34,377
Looks like
you're not the only one

931
00:38:34,401 --> 00:38:36,100
I'm going to have to
make good with.

932
00:38:36,136 --> 00:38:37,535
But what were you talking about

933
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:39,204
before he came
storming in here?

934
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:41,839
It doesn't matter,
what matters is

935
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:44,909
what are we going to do
about Louis?

936
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:54,164
- Beautiful girls.
- They take after their mother.

937
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,565
Hm, well, I hear their father

938
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:57,267
is going after
Starboard Airlines.

939
00:38:57,302 --> 00:39:00,170
- Where'd you hear that?
- I'll take that as a yes.

940
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:04,107
- And what if I am?
- If I were you, I'd stop.

941
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:06,543
And if I were me,
I'd say you're only saying that

942
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:07,978
because they used to be
your client,

943
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,244
and you're not going to like
how it looks

944
00:39:09,245 --> 00:39:10,711
when they become mine.

945
00:39:10,746 --> 00:39:13,213
I'm saying that
because Gavin Andrews

946
00:39:13,249 --> 00:39:14,926
is a hell of a lot more
than meets the eye,

947
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,650
and the guy isn't worth
the trouble.

948
00:39:16,685 --> 00:39:18,619
What kind of trouble?

949
00:39:18,654 --> 00:39:22,089
Let's just say I would have
thought a guy with your history

950
00:39:22,124 --> 00:39:23,557
would want to be more careful

951
00:39:23,592 --> 00:39:25,692
about who he
gets into bed with.

952
00:39:25,728 --> 00:39:27,472
What the hell are you doing
looking into my history?

953
00:39:27,496 --> 00:39:29,696
I'm doing what you
should be doing with him.

954
00:39:29,732 --> 00:39:31,398
Then tell me
what you're talking about,

955
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:33,533
or get out of
my goddamn office

956
00:39:33,569 --> 00:39:35,769
because I've got
a client to sign.

957
00:39:35,804 --> 00:39:39,473
Sorry to bother you, Alex.
Good luck with that client.

958
00:39:56,790 --> 00:40:01,125
- There's my lion.
- Are you naked under there?

959
00:40:01,161 --> 00:40:03,094
This is my sex robe,
isn't it?

960
00:40:03,129 --> 00:40:04,740
Yeah, of course, I would
recognize that anywhere,

961
00:40:04,764 --> 00:40:06,431
but Sheila,
where is this coming from?

962
00:40:06,466 --> 00:40:08,733
It's coming from right there.

963
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:19,611
- Oh, my God, they heard me.
- They heard you roar.

964
00:40:19,646 --> 00:40:23,247
Because you are a lion.
- I am, aren't I?

965
00:40:23,283 --> 00:40:25,316
Yes, you are.

966
00:40:25,352 --> 00:40:29,120
And you should know that you're
not the only one with a clock.

967
00:40:29,155 --> 00:40:30,622
The dean gave you
a clock today, too?

968
00:40:30,657 --> 00:40:34,425
Not that kind of clock.
I have an internal clock.

969
00:40:34,861 --> 00:40:36,805
Sheila, are you saying
what I think you're saying?

970
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:40,031
Yes, I am,
because when I told you

971
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:44,735
you're the perfect man,
Louis Litt, I meant it.

972
00:40:45,462 --> 00:40:48,196
And I want to make
a perfect baby with you.

973
00:40:52,936 --> 00:40:55,803
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

974
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,040
And I don't want to just
pull the goalie.

975
00:40:59,075 --> 00:41:01,142
I want to start trying.

976
00:41:01,177 --> 00:41:04,312
And I want to start trying
right now.

977
00:41:04,347 --> 00:41:06,080
This is incredible.

978
00:41:07,984 --> 00:41:10,518
Can we still do it dirty?
- Of course.

979
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:12,086
Why couldn't we do it dirty?

980
00:41:12,122 --> 00:41:13,866
Because I don't want our son
to think of us that way.

981
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:17,058
Louis, our unborn son
will be a Litt.

982
00:41:17,514 --> 00:41:19,781
He'll respect us
for being dirty.

983
00:41:19,816 --> 00:41:22,083
You're 100% right, we can be
as filthy as we want.

984
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:24,152
- I'll get the bananas.
- What are you, crazy?

985
00:41:24,188 --> 00:41:25,698
You're going to be
the mother of my child.

986
00:41:25,722 --> 00:41:27,022
I'll get the bananas.

987
00:41:37,134 --> 00:41:38,900
You know, the elevators
come a lot faster

988
00:41:38,936 --> 00:41:41,169
when you actually call them.

989
00:41:41,205 --> 00:41:43,405
I was just thinking.

990
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,373
Well, I wanted to
let you know that I finished

991
00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:47,242
checking on Samantha.

992
00:41:47,277 --> 00:41:49,044
And?

993
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:51,680
As far as I can tell,
she may not be Mother Teresa,

994
00:41:51,715 --> 00:41:53,548
but she's an asset to the team.

995
00:41:53,584 --> 00:41:55,684
I guess that depends
on who the team is.

996
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:57,752
- What do you mean?
- Zane promised Samantha

997
00:41:57,788 --> 00:42:00,522
she'd be the next name partner.

998
00:42:00,755 --> 00:42:03,289
And did you tell him that you
made the same promise to Alex?

999
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:05,188
No, I didn't.

1000
00:42:05,224 --> 00:42:07,638
Harvey, you can't put them
both up at the same time.

1001
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:09,964
It'll dilute the promotion
for both of them.

1002
00:42:09,965 --> 00:42:11,164
I know.

1003
00:42:13,435 --> 00:42:15,235
So what are you going to do?

1004
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,304
I'm going to do
what Jessica would.

1005
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:19,940
I'm going to go home,
make myself a drink,

1006
00:42:19,975 --> 00:42:22,175
and figure out
how to get my way.
