1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,231
<i>Previously on "Suits"...</i>

2
00:00:01,232 --> 00:00:03,571
Was this whole thing
designed to get Restoration

3
00:00:03,572 --> 00:00:04,838
back to the table?

4
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:07,032
It was designed to either
get them back

5
00:00:07,033 --> 00:00:08,899
or to take a chance
on an up-and-comer.

6
00:00:08,935 --> 00:00:10,926
Thomas isn't gonna want to be
in business with Simon

7
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:11,976
when he finds out about this.

8
00:00:11,977 --> 00:00:13,502
And he's not going
to find out about it,

9
00:00:13,503 --> 00:00:14,969
because we're not
gonna tell him.

10
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:16,737
Get on the ground.
Wallet and phone.

11
00:00:16,773 --> 00:00:18,472
The same thing
that happened to you

12
00:00:18,508 --> 00:00:19,640
happened to me.

13
00:00:19,676 --> 00:00:20,608
The deal you made
was a ploy

14
00:00:20,643 --> 00:00:23,377
to get Restoration Hardware
to the table.

15
00:00:23,413 --> 00:00:24,924
- You know.
- You're damn right I know.

16
00:00:24,948 --> 00:00:27,648
I'm taking Glen's offer
at the original rate,

17
00:00:27,684 --> 00:00:29,717
and I'm putting out
an announcement about it.

18
00:00:29,752 --> 00:00:31,319
You cannot do what we did.

19
00:00:31,354 --> 00:00:32,920
I'm telling you,
you'll regret it.

20
00:00:32,956 --> 00:00:34,355
You didn't regret it.

21
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,467
You don't know
what happens over time

22
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:37,091
when you do
something like that.

23
00:00:37,126 --> 00:00:39,827
I'm upset
because I lost a client.

24
00:00:39,863 --> 00:00:41,829
No, you are upset because
I chose Thomas over you.

25
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:43,364
Louis didn't get
the wrong guy,

26
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:44,932
and neither did you and I.

27
00:00:44,968 --> 00:00:46,601
It's not about
the wrong man.

28
00:00:46,636 --> 00:00:48,380
It's about taking matters
into your own hands

29
00:00:48,404 --> 00:00:50,004
and what happens
when you do that.

30
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,039
You broke privilege,

31
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:55,443
and now
I'm gonna make you pay.

32
00:01:07,757 --> 00:01:10,057
- Thomas, hi.
<i>- Hey.</i>

33
00:01:10,093 --> 00:01:11,525
You busy tonight?

34
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:13,828
<i>Actually, I think</i>
<i>I'm gonna work late.</i>

35
00:01:14,964 --> 00:01:17,465
Donna, you okay?
You sound upset.

36
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:21,042
I didn't know you were
gonna put out a press release

37
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,637
when you took that other offer.

38
00:01:22,672 --> 00:01:23,704
<i>Donna, the risk you run</i>

39
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,572
when you're known
as a nice guy is,

40
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:25,985
people think
they can push you around.

41
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:28,976
I had to show them
that if you push me,

42
00:01:29,012 --> 00:01:31,779
I'm gonna push right back,
and I'm sorry that resulted

43
00:01:31,814 --> 00:01:33,114
in your firm getting fired.

44
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:34,782
We're not just
getting fired, Thomas.

45
00:01:34,817 --> 00:01:36,150
We're getting sued.

46
00:01:36,185 --> 00:01:39,153
Oh, shit.

47
00:01:39,188 --> 00:01:40,821
Well, no wonder you're upset.

48
00:01:40,857 --> 00:01:43,090
You guys are getting sued
because of me.

49
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:46,761
Well, that's the thing.
It's not just because of you.

50
00:01:46,796 --> 00:01:49,063
It's because of me.

51
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:57,838
Robert.

52
00:01:57,874 --> 00:01:58,773
If you're here for a drink,
I'd love to,

53
00:01:58,808 --> 00:02:00,741
but I've already had
a long week,

54
00:02:00,777 --> 00:02:02,576
and Rosalie's expecting me.

55
00:02:02,612 --> 00:02:03,577
I'm not here for a drink.

56
00:02:03,613 --> 00:02:05,046
What's on your mind?

57
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:06,681
That prison situation

58
00:02:06,716 --> 00:02:08,516
you had
a couple years back.

59
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:10,584
What about it?

60
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,453
Those men murdered
an innocent man.

61
00:02:12,488 --> 00:02:14,155
You knew about it.

62
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,990
And you didn't do anything.

63
00:02:16,025 --> 00:02:17,458
You here to make me
feel like shit,

64
00:02:17,493 --> 00:02:18,704
or is there a point
in there somewhere?

65
00:02:18,728 --> 00:02:21,495
I'm not judging you, Alex.

66
00:02:21,531 --> 00:02:23,130
I did something
some years back

67
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,099
that I'm not proud of
either.

68
00:02:25,134 --> 00:02:28,836
And I guess I'm wondering...

69
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:31,605
how do you live with it?

70
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:33,975
At first, I tried
putting it out of my mind.

71
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,944
But then it kept
popping back up.

72
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,013
Then I thought about
doing something, but...

73
00:02:39,048 --> 00:02:41,482
anything I tried, I'd just
end up in prison myself

74
00:02:41,517 --> 00:02:42,350
for something I didn't do.

75
00:02:42,385 --> 00:02:43,951
Mm.

76
00:02:43,987 --> 00:02:45,987
So I guess the question is,

77
00:02:46,022 --> 00:02:48,189
can you do something
about what you did?

78
00:02:48,224 --> 00:02:50,791
No, I can't.

79
00:02:50,827 --> 00:02:52,638
Then all you can do is try
and make up for it somehow

80
00:02:52,662 --> 00:02:54,528
the rest of your life.

81
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:04,171
<i>You stuck around and ate</i>
<i>the rest of my Chinese,</i>

82
00:03:04,207 --> 00:03:04,972
didn't you?

83
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:06,051
You think Laura's
gonna let me

84
00:03:06,075 --> 00:03:08,209
get egg rolls
and fried rice at home?

85
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:10,923
<i>Look, I wanted to thank you</i>
<i>for staying late.</i>

86
00:03:10,947 --> 00:03:12,313
<i>It means a lot.</i>

87
00:03:12,348 --> 00:03:13,348
Don't mention it, Robert.

88
00:03:13,383 --> 00:03:15,649
Whatever you need, I'm here.

89
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:16,517
<i>You know that.</i>

90
00:03:16,552 --> 00:03:17,351
I know this
sweet and sour chicken

91
00:03:17,387 --> 00:03:18,886
isn't gonna eat itself.

92
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:20,821
No, it won't--

93
00:03:20,857 --> 00:03:21,822
Oh!

94
00:03:23,026 --> 00:03:24,725
Samantha, you still there?

95
00:03:27,096 --> 00:03:28,596
Robert, call 911!

96
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:29,764

What are you doing here?

113
00:04:17,151 --> 00:04:18,517
We have a problem.

114
00:04:18,553 --> 00:04:20,252
Come in.

115
00:04:23,558 --> 00:04:25,424
What is it?

116
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,026
Long story short,

117
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:30,096
Simon Lowe tried to
screw over Thomas Kessler.

118
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:31,909
You mean that lease deal
that came across my desk

119
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:33,477
was bullshit?
- Yes, that's what I mean.

120
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:34,645
Well, Harvey, I know Thomas
is one of my oldest clients,

121
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:35,868
but you can't tell him.

122
00:04:35,903 --> 00:04:39,305
We're way past that, Louis.
Donna told him.

123
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,940
What?
How could she even know?

124
00:04:40,975 --> 00:04:42,308
Because I told her.

125
00:04:42,343 --> 00:04:43,609
Why the hell
would you do that?

126
00:04:43,644 --> 00:04:45,055
Because she knew
something was wrong,

127
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,223
and I didn't know
what else to do.

128
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:49,215
I told her to give me
some time so I could fix it.

129
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,384
But before I could,
she told him.

130
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,253
Then Thomas bailed, and Simon
suspected what happened.

131
00:04:54,288 --> 00:04:56,055
Let me guess.
He fired us.

132
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,057
He didn't just fire us,
Louis.

133
00:04:58,092 --> 00:05:00,960
He hired Daniel Hardman
to sue us.

134
00:05:04,265 --> 00:05:05,998
Say that again.

135
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:08,134
- Simon hired--
- No, tell me again

136
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:11,070
that Donna put her
goddamn relationship above us

137
00:05:11,105 --> 00:05:14,440
and now Daniel fucking Hardman
is suing my firm.

138
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:16,075
You want to get
pissed off at Donna,

139
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,410
or you want
to figure this out?

140
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:21,280
I want to figure this out.

141
00:05:21,315 --> 00:05:23,082
And I sure as shit know
you didn't come here

142
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:25,084
without a plan,
so what do you have?

143
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,286
As I see it,
we have two options,

144
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:29,288
the first of which
involves going to Robert.

145
00:05:29,323 --> 00:05:30,289
Pass.

146
00:05:30,324 --> 00:05:31,435
Look, he's the only one of us

147
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:33,092
that actually
gets along with Hardman.

148
00:05:33,127 --> 00:05:33,893
It's the only chance
we have

149
00:05:33,928 --> 00:05:35,005
of getting him
to be reasonable.

150
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:36,062
And you and I both know

151
00:05:36,097 --> 00:05:38,631
that there isn't a frozen
dick's chance in hell

152
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:42,101
that that <i>rat</i>
is gonna be reasonable.

153
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:44,970
Then tomorrow morning,
you and I need to go in there

154
00:05:45,006 --> 00:05:46,072
with an offer so good,

155
00:05:46,107 --> 00:05:48,474
Simon has no choice
but to take it

156
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:52,611
and Daniel's left with nothing
but a frozen dick in his hand.

157
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:15,501
Robert,
what are you doing here?

158
00:06:15,536 --> 00:06:19,305
I came as soon as I found out
where they took you.

159
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,408
- My purse, it had--
- Don't worry about it.

160
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:26,145
The important thing is,
you're here.

161
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,182
I am so sorry, Samantha.

162
00:06:30,218 --> 00:06:32,218
I never should have
kept you so late.

163
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:34,520
It's not your fault,
Robert.

164
00:06:34,555 --> 00:06:36,689
If anything, I should have
had my guard up.

165
00:06:36,724 --> 00:06:37,756
This isn't on you.

166
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:41,026
This is on that piece of shit
who did this to you.

167
00:06:41,062 --> 00:06:42,328
You're right.

168
00:06:42,363 --> 00:06:44,263
We need to get
to the police station.

169
00:06:44,298 --> 00:06:46,176
- I want to make a statement.
- You can do that tomorrow.

170
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,178
- Right now, you need to rest.
- No. If they have any chance

171
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:50,269
of catching this guy,
the first 24 hours--

172
00:06:50,304 --> 00:06:52,037
Samantha,
whatever we have to do

173
00:06:52,073 --> 00:06:53,617
to make this right, I'm gonna
be right there with you.

174
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:57,176
But tonight, you're staying put
and getting better.

175
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:00,079
Okay.

176
00:07:04,118 --> 00:07:06,652
Thanks for being here,
Robert.

177
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:10,789
I'll always
be here for you, Samantha.

178
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:16,228
Robert.
You need something?

179
00:07:16,264 --> 00:07:19,198
Yeah. You hear about this
Hardman-Pierpont Malls thing?

180
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:21,400
I did.
Alex told me.

181
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:23,369
- What did he say?
- He said he wasn't too happy

182
00:07:23,404 --> 00:07:25,738
with Donna making him look
like shit with his own client.

183
00:07:25,773 --> 00:07:27,706
Mm. Can't blame the man
for that.

184
00:07:27,742 --> 00:07:29,508
No. You can't.

185
00:07:31,846 --> 00:07:33,546
Robert, are you okay?

186
00:07:33,581 --> 00:07:35,548
Because ever since
that thing with Louis--

187
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,616
I'm fine, Samantha.
Do me a favor.

188
00:07:37,652 --> 00:07:39,652
Get to know everything
there is to know

189
00:07:39,687 --> 00:07:41,487
about this whole
Hardman situation.

190
00:07:41,522 --> 00:07:44,156
You never know how
it's gonna shake out.

191
00:07:50,431 --> 00:07:54,166
Harvey, Louis,
good of both of you to come.

192
00:07:54,202 --> 00:07:55,913
- Can I offer you a beverage?
- Oh, actually, yeah.

193
00:07:55,937 --> 00:07:57,570
because this thing's
ending right now.

194
00:07:57,605 --> 00:07:59,738
- What is that?
- We're doubling the money

195
00:07:59,774 --> 00:08:01,907
that you lost
when Kessler backed out.

196
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:03,742
This says that Kessler
found out about

197
00:08:03,778 --> 00:08:06,378
the Restoration deal
because of a clerical error.

198
00:08:06,414 --> 00:08:08,447
That's right.
Information was included

199
00:08:08,482 --> 00:08:10,649
on certain deal memos
that were just--

200
00:08:10,685 --> 00:08:12,651
Bullshit!
You told Alex Williams.

201
00:08:12,687 --> 00:08:14,598
And a clerical error isn't
gonna cut it with his board.

202
00:08:14,622 --> 00:08:15,588
They need a head to roll.

203
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:16,900
Louis is just too stupid
to understand that.

204
00:08:16,924 --> 00:08:19,525
You arrogant son of a bitch.
You always underestimated me.

205
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,594
And you're
underestimating me,

206
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:23,207
because if I'd wanted
to settle with you,

207
00:08:23,231 --> 00:08:24,797
I wouldn't have called
Daniel Hardman.

208
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:26,699
I thought you said
you called him.

209
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:29,835
Did I? I must have made
a clerical error.

210
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,603
Regardless,

211
00:08:30,638 --> 00:08:33,038
it's Louis' firm now,
not yours.

212
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:35,774
And, Louis, we go to court,
the world's gonna discover

213
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,209
that your firm
can't be trusted,

214
00:08:37,245 --> 00:08:39,745
and then you will be
the king of nothing.

215
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,947
But if you admit
that Harvey broke privilege,

216
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,716
this can all go away.

217
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:44,950
I see what this is.

218
00:08:44,986 --> 00:08:47,820
You want to use that admission
to come after Harvey's license.

219
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,589
Look at that.

220
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,459
I didn't think you had it
in you to figure it out.

221
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:55,894
Let me tell you something
that you will never figure out.

222
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,530
Leaders never betray
their partners.

223
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:00,299
Let's save
the betrayal talk

224
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:02,701
for Harvey's ethics hearing,
shall we?

225
00:09:02,737 --> 00:09:03,747
I imagine I can win
this lawsuit

226
00:09:03,771 --> 00:09:05,704
and have it scheduled
by the end of the month.

227
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,872
You do this,
I promise you,

228
00:09:06,907 --> 00:09:08,018
I'll be the biggest regret
of your life.

229
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:09,608
No, Harvey.
My biggest regret is,

230
00:09:09,644 --> 00:09:12,811
I wasn't the one to rip
Jessica's name off the wall,

231
00:09:12,847 --> 00:09:16,181
so I'll just have to settle
for ripping yours off instead.

232
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:18,417
Good day,

233
00:09:18,452 --> 00:09:20,519
gentlemen.

234
00:09:20,554 --> 00:09:22,721
Harvey, how did it go
with Hardman?

235
00:09:22,757 --> 00:09:24,223
It didn't.

236
00:09:24,258 --> 00:09:25,391
What does that mean?

237
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:26,992
It means he's not
just suing us.

238
00:09:27,028 --> 00:09:28,238
He's trying to get
a guilty verdict

239
00:09:28,262 --> 00:09:30,496
so he can use it
and come after my license.

240
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:31,397
What?

241
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:33,499
- No, he can't do that!
- He can, Donna,

242
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:35,701
because I broke privilege,
and he knows it.

243
00:09:35,736 --> 00:09:37,269
But you didn't
break privilege.

244
00:09:37,305 --> 00:09:38,737
I'm the one
who told Thomas.

245
00:09:38,773 --> 00:09:39,605
And I'm the one
who told Alex,

246
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,884
and that's how they think
Thomas knows.

247
00:09:40,908 --> 00:09:41,674
So what are we gonna do?

248
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:44,343
<i>We</i> aren't doing anything.

249
00:09:44,378 --> 00:09:46,211
Louis and I
are handling this.

250
00:09:46,247 --> 00:09:48,213
But if I told them
that it was me and not you--

251
00:09:48,249 --> 00:09:49,214
You'd just make it worse.

252
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,350
We told them
it was a clerical error,

253
00:09:51,385 --> 00:09:53,852
and you'd be proving we did
what they're accusing us of.

254
00:09:53,888 --> 00:09:55,621
Harvey, I'm responsible
for this.

255
00:09:55,656 --> 00:09:57,523
I want to help.

256
00:09:57,558 --> 00:09:58,957
I'm sorry, Donna, but--

257
00:09:58,993 --> 00:10:00,693
I get it.

258
00:10:00,728 --> 00:10:01,805
If I really wanted to help,

259
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:03,962
I never would have told Thomas
in the first place.

260
00:10:03,998 --> 00:10:06,532
Well, I was gonna say
the genie's out of the bottle.

261
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:07,666
We can't put it back in.

262
00:10:07,702 --> 00:10:10,736
But what you can do is let
Louis and I do what we have to

263
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:12,738
to get us out of this.

264
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:16,675
Samantha,
how are you doing?

265
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:17,543
Physically, I'm fine.

266
00:10:17,578 --> 00:10:19,712
Mentally,
I am pissed the fuck off.

267
00:10:19,747 --> 00:10:20,546
You want to talk about it?

268
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:21,825
Because we can get you
some counseling.

269
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:22,815
This isn't about
my feelings, Robert.

270
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,718
I got mugged like 30 other
people that night.

271
00:10:25,753 --> 00:10:27,553
The police aren't gonna
do anything about it,

272
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:28,320
and you know it.

273
00:10:28,356 --> 00:10:29,388
What are you getting at?

274
00:10:29,423 --> 00:10:31,323
I want the name
of your investigator

275
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:33,225
and a few days off
to handle this.

276
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,561
You think I'm gonna let you
track down this guy yourself?

277
00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:37,529
- Listen to me--
- No.

278
00:10:37,565 --> 00:10:39,398
Let's say you find him.
What happens then?

279
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:41,600
You hear of
an eye for an eye?

280
00:10:41,635 --> 00:10:43,469
That's what happens.

281
00:10:43,504 --> 00:10:46,405
Look, if someone attacks you,
they attack me.

282
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,441
So we're gonna go to my guy
and find this son of a bitch.

283
00:10:49,477 --> 00:10:51,844
But when we do,
we turn him over to the DA

284
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,278
and let them do
what they do.

285
00:10:53,314 --> 00:10:54,246
No, that won't work!

286
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:56,582
I'm not asking, Samantha.
I'm telling.

287
00:10:56,617 --> 00:10:58,584
If you want justice,
you're gonna get it.

288
00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:00,886
That's the only way
this happens.

289
00:11:01,989 --> 00:11:04,656
Okay.

290
00:11:04,692 --> 00:11:06,458
We'll do it your way.

291
00:11:06,494 --> 00:11:08,660
Just give me the name
of your investigator.

292
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:15,267
Harvey.
What an unpleasant surprise.

293
00:11:15,302 --> 00:11:18,003
Well, it's about to get
more unpleasant,

294
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:19,878
because I got to thinking:
if Simon was willing

295
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:21,607
to double deal
behind Thomas' back,

296
00:11:21,642 --> 00:11:23,909
what's to stop him from
doing it with someone else?

297
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:27,780
That is evidence
of an off-the-books meeting

298
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:30,949
between two of the largest
mall owners in America,

299
00:11:30,985 --> 00:11:33,452
divvying up retailers
and colluding on rents.

300
00:11:33,487 --> 00:11:36,054
So I'm giving you
a one-time opportunity

301
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,924
to save Simon an investigation.

302
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,959
Well, Harvey, you're right.

303
00:11:40,995 --> 00:11:42,795
Simon did get into a room
with Westhaven,

304
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,996
and it was off the books.

305
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:45,564
But they weren't colluding.

306
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:47,310
- They were discussing a merger.
- Bullshit.

307
00:11:47,334 --> 00:11:48,634
I represented him.

308
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:50,369
He never said anything
about this.

309
00:11:50,404 --> 00:11:52,504
I'd be happy to show you
the offer we made to them.

310
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,573
And I assure you,
they have a copy

311
00:11:54,608 --> 00:11:55,608
in their files right now.

312
00:11:55,643 --> 00:11:57,387
Because you went back
and created a paper trail.

313
00:11:57,411 --> 00:11:58,555
Which means
all you have on Simon

314
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:01,647
are a couple of dates
on a calendar.

315
00:12:01,682 --> 00:12:03,727
And all you have on me
is conjecture about what I may

316
00:12:03,751 --> 00:12:05,551
or may not have done.
- No, Harvey.

317
00:12:05,586 --> 00:12:07,653
I have a phone call you made
to Travis Tanner

318
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:10,389
the night before
Restoration backed out.

319
00:12:10,424 --> 00:12:12,558
Turns out, Travis just happens
to represent

320
00:12:12,593 --> 00:12:14,259
the competitor of Simon's

321
00:12:14,295 --> 00:12:15,994
that was drawing up an offer
to Restoration

322
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,930
when Kessler backed out.

323
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:20,599
Do you think Tanner
will protect you

324
00:12:20,634 --> 00:12:21,533
when I get him on the stand?

325
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:22,935
You son of a bitch.

326
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,136
Now, now.

327
00:12:24,171 --> 00:12:26,738
Name-calling
won't get us anywhere.

328
00:12:26,774 --> 00:12:28,507
Or maybe it will.

329
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:30,943
Because I'm willing
to drop this whole thing

330
00:12:30,978 --> 00:12:32,845
if you will do me
the simple courtesy

331
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,414
of putting my name
back up on your wall.

332
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:38,417
You would have to resign,
of course.

333
00:12:38,452 --> 00:12:41,954
But at least you'd be able
to slink away

334
00:12:41,989 --> 00:12:44,022
and start up somewhere else,

335
00:12:44,058 --> 00:12:45,891
like you did to me.

336
00:12:45,926 --> 00:12:47,459
You really think I'm gonna

337
00:12:47,495 --> 00:12:48,538
let you get away with this,
don't you?

338
00:12:48,562 --> 00:12:51,530
I think you did
what I'm accusing you of,

339
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:54,066
and the chickens
are coming home to roost.

340
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,413
Are you up to speed
on Hardman?

341
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:03,615
I am.

342
00:13:03,651 --> 00:13:05,384
Robert, he's not
gonna give up,

343
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:07,386
and if this thing plays out
the way it's headed--

344
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:10,489
I know. That's why
I came up with this.

345
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:14,860
- Are you crazy?
- No, I'm not.

346
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:16,628
But I need you
to make that happen.

347
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:17,808
Well, then think
of something else,

348
00:13:17,832 --> 00:13:19,876
because I'll never be able
to convince him to do this.

349
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,467
Samantha, you have
convinced people

350
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:22,712
of a hell of a lot more
than this.

351
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:24,781
Because I could get to them.
He won't even take my call.

352
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,772
Well, he's sure as shit
not gonna take mine.

353
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,540
And you can use
his hatred of me to--

354
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:29,541
You, me--it won't make
a difference.

355
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:31,610
- He hates us both.
- And if we don't do this--

356
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:32,823
I know what's at stake,
Robert.

357
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:34,646
Then I need you
to get this done.

358
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:37,683
Because I agree--
if this thing plays out

359
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:39,785
the way that it's headed...

360
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:43,388
All right.

361
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:45,424
I'll make it happen.

362
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,963
Louis.

363
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:56,546
This is only the second time
you've ever come to my home.

364
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,403
First time I was here,

365
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:00,405
I told you that I got you
out of a jam.

366
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:02,841
This time, I'm asking you
to get me out of one.

367
00:14:02,877 --> 00:14:04,788
If you're talking about
Simon Lowe suing your firm,

368
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:06,612
I heard about that,
and I'm sorry.

369
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:08,747
Well, he's not just
suing the firm, Thomas.

370
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:10,082
His lawyer's using the suit

371
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:11,428
to come after
my partner's license.

372
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:14,686
- You mean Harvey Specter.
- Yes, I do.

373
00:14:14,722 --> 00:14:17,489
So as your first lawyer
and your friend,

374
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:19,591
I'm asking you to help me.

375
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:21,360
Help you how?

376
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:22,439
Simon's lawyer
is trying to prove

377
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,729
that Harvey broke privilege,

378
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:24,630
and the only people
they can go after

379
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:27,299
are Harvey, Alex, Donna...

380
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:28,834
- And me.
- That's right.

381
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,480
And Daniel Hardman
has not subpoenaed you yet,

382
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:31,648
but it's only
a matter of time.

383
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:33,772
And you want me to what?
Leave town?

384
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:35,474
- Or worse yet--
- No, Thomas--

385
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:37,442
No, no, I don't
believe this, Louis.

386
00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:39,912
The guy helped Simon Lowe
try to screw me over,

387
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:41,024
and you want me
to cover for him.

388
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:43,282
Thomas, listen to me.
I know you value honesty,

389
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:44,983
so I'm gonna be
perfectly honest with you.

390
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,518
Simon was a bigger client.

391
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:47,998
And Harvey should have
sided with him,

392
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:50,489
but he tried
to protect you anyway.

393
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:51,456
And if you don't
cover for him,

394
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:54,526
all it's gonna do
is take down a good man

395
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:56,495
who <i>I</i> care about.

396
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,731
I'm sorry, Louis.

397
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:02,000
If this Daniel Hardman
subpoenas me,

398
00:15:02,036 --> 00:15:03,969
I won't perjure myself.

399
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:11,143
I assume you're here
to discuss my pending action

400
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,011
against your firm.
- I am.

401
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:16,748
I'm also here to drink
this 30-year scotch

402
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:18,917
with an old friend.

403
00:15:18,953 --> 00:15:20,519
I appreciate that, Robert.

404
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:21,587
But what's the saying?

405
00:15:21,622 --> 00:15:23,755
Never trust Greeks
bearing gifts?

406
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:24,656
I look Greek to you?

407
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:25,490
You look like a man

408
00:15:25,526 --> 00:15:27,693
who's trying to have it
both ways.

409
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:29,105
And you look like one
who's letting a vendetta

410
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,996
cloud his judgment.

411
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,698
They took my firm, Robert.

412
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:34,399
It's not a judgment.
That's a fact.

413
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:36,012
And from what I recall,
you all but handed it to them

414
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:37,102
with your indiscretions.

415
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:37,970
And if you're here
to litigate the past--

416
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:40,439
- Fuck the past, Daniel.

417
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:41,674
I'm here to work
something out.

418
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:44,042
What will it take
for you to drop this thing?

419
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:46,578
I said what it would take:
my old firm back

420
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:48,580
and Harvey Specter's
resignation.

421
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:50,549
Now, you know
I can't do that.

422
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:51,850
Why not?

423
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:54,186
Because Rachel married
his protégé?

424
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:57,556
Because you and Jessica broke
the glass ceiling together?

425
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:59,124
We were friends
before any of that.

426
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,926
We talked about starting
a firm together.

427
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:01,793
I know that we did.

428
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:04,062
Then why are you
siding with them?

429
00:16:04,098 --> 00:16:06,798
They stole <i>everything</i>
I built, Robert,

430
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:08,467
forced me out in disgrace,

431
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:10,535
and I have been in
the wilderness ever since.

432
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:13,205
And until my name
is up on that wall,

433
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,540
I'm not dropping this.

434
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:22,047
Then what if I can get
your name up somewhere else?

435
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,082
You mean Rand Kaldor.

436
00:16:24,118 --> 00:16:26,918
Ever since I left the firm,
they've been one man down.

437
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:28,587
You could come in and--and--

438
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:30,055
And what?

439
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,957
They hate you
as much as I hate Harvey.

440
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,592
Why would they throw you
a lifeline?

441
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:36,094
Because you're
Daniel goddamn Hardman,

442
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,496
that's why.

443
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,068
Okay, Robert.

444
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:45,170
You get Eric and Ellen
to go in on this,

445
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:46,972
I will let this go.

446
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,775
But if you can't,

447
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,244
our friendship
isn't gonna stop me

448
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,613
from taking Harvey down.

449
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,624
So...how'd it go
with Daniel?

450
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:07,125
It didn't.

451
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:08,794
What do you mean,
it didn't?

452
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:11,163
He already backdated
an excuse, and not only that.

453
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:14,199
He found out I went to Tanner
behind Simon's back.

454
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:15,867
Wait, you did what?

455
00:17:15,903 --> 00:17:18,270
I was trying to save Thomas'
deal without telling him.

456
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:19,382
- I had to go to somebody--
- You know what? Never mind.

457
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:20,372
I don't give a shit.
But what we need to do

458
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:23,308
is figure something out,
because this is my firm,

459
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:25,844
and I'm not gonna let that
son of a bitch take it from me.

460
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,779
- Louis--
- Why did you have to tell her?

461
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:29,181
That's what I don't get.
Why?

462
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,982
He was my client
for 13 years.

463
00:17:31,018 --> 00:17:32,718
I wouldn't have
told her.

464
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:34,820
Yes, Louis,
you would have.

465
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:36,321
Last year, you came to me

466
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,156
about putting Sheila
over the firm.

467
00:17:38,192 --> 00:17:40,192
And I told you
as managing partner,

468
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,293
I wouldn't do it,

469
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:43,995
but as your friend,
I would.

470
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:46,164
If I had asked you
about telling Donna,

471
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,266
you would have done
the same thing.

472
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:51,636
You're right.

473
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:54,172
I would.

474
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,874
God damn it!

475
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,309
What's going on, Louis?

476
00:17:57,344 --> 00:17:59,811
Thomas said
that he wouldn't help us.

477
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:01,546
You mean
he wouldn't help me.

478
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:02,859
Yeah, I guess
that's what I mean.

479
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:06,551
Why couldn't Donna
just wait for you?

480
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:08,253
I don't know, Louis.

481
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,022
I really don't know.

482
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:13,158
You think you would have
come through if she had?

483
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:14,493
Well, I'd like
to think so.

484
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:17,162
Yeah, well, I do too.

485
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:20,165
'Cause let's face it, Harvey:
you pretty much always do.

486
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:23,902
You're right, Louis.
I do.

487
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,937
And right now, I think I can.

488
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:27,706
What do you got?

489
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:30,742
They said a head
needs to roll on this.

490
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:33,011
What if, instead
of one head rolling,

491
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:34,913
we give them two?

492
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:39,271
Good. You're here.

493
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:41,871
I was going over
my testimony

494
00:18:41,907 --> 00:18:44,174
and could use
another set of eyes.

495
00:18:46,532 --> 00:18:49,600
I don't know
how to tell you this.

496
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:52,002
I talked to Cameron Dennis.

497
00:18:52,037 --> 00:18:54,438
The guy's friends put him
at a different location, and--

498
00:18:54,473 --> 00:18:56,440
Don't you fucking say it.

499
00:18:56,475 --> 00:18:58,342
Samantha, I'm sorry.

500
00:18:58,377 --> 00:19:00,844
I never should have
listened to you.

501
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,679
Look,
I know you're upset--

502
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:05,015
Save it. I've got
something to take care of.

503
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,384
So what are you gonna do,
hire someone to break his legs?

504
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:09,019
God damn it, you told me

505
00:19:09,054 --> 00:19:11,388
if we did this right,
there would be justice.

506
00:19:11,423 --> 00:19:12,656
Where is the justice?

507
00:19:14,093 --> 00:19:16,593
That son of a bitch gets off,
you know what that makes me?

508
00:19:16,629 --> 00:19:18,362
A victim.

509
00:19:18,397 --> 00:19:20,764
I am not a victim, Robert!

510
00:19:32,678 --> 00:19:35,112
One of my foster parents
would hit me.

511
00:19:39,185 --> 00:19:42,553
It's why I joined the service,
why I learned self-defense.

512
00:19:45,658 --> 00:19:47,658
I can't be a victim
again, Robert.

513
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:50,561
I just...can't.

514
00:19:52,865 --> 00:19:54,731
All right, then.

515
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:57,501
We'll go the other way.

516
00:19:57,536 --> 00:19:59,503
What are you
talking about?

517
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:01,405
Cameron Dennis said

518
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,574
that if any new evidence
came to light,

519
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:05,175
he'll prosecute.

520
00:20:08,447 --> 00:20:10,581
Let's get to
doing that, then.

521
00:20:10,616 --> 00:20:12,482
No.

522
00:20:12,518 --> 00:20:15,185
You took a risk once
to get me this firm.

523
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:20,090
It's time I took a risk...
for you.

524
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:27,164
God damn it, Ellen, there's
got to be something you'd--

525
00:20:28,901 --> 00:20:31,768
Well, in that case,
go to hell.

526
00:20:33,138 --> 00:20:35,138
Well, how much?

527
00:20:35,174 --> 00:20:37,207
What's the bastard's price?

528
00:20:37,243 --> 00:20:38,709
There is no price, Robert.

529
00:20:38,744 --> 00:20:40,711
He said no amount
of money or clients

530
00:20:40,746 --> 00:20:42,946
would make up for seeing
his firm get torn apart.

531
00:20:42,982 --> 00:20:45,026
But what about Ellen?
You try horse trading with her?

532
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,050
I did, and I struck out
there too.

533
00:20:47,086 --> 00:20:50,354
God damn it, Samantha!
I got Daniel to agree!

534
00:20:50,389 --> 00:20:52,167
He thought I came up
with Rand Kaldor on the fly,

535
00:20:52,191 --> 00:20:53,557
and I sold it to him.

536
00:20:53,592 --> 00:20:54,603
What do you want me to say?

537
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:57,494
I want you to tell me
exactly what happened.

538
00:20:57,529 --> 00:20:59,129
Because Eric Kaldor
and Ellen Rand

539
00:20:59,164 --> 00:21:00,575
are two of the greediest
people I know.

540
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,832
So if you're trying to tell me

541
00:21:01,867 --> 00:21:03,044
that they're standing
on principle,

542
00:21:03,068 --> 00:21:04,468
I'm calling bullshit!

543
00:21:04,503 --> 00:21:05,547
And it's pretty clear
what happened.

544
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:06,882
Eric tried to force
something down your throat,

545
00:21:06,906 --> 00:21:10,240
and you let your pride
get in the way--like always.

546
00:21:10,276 --> 00:21:13,644
Robert...
I offered him

547
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,712
half your client list,

548
00:21:15,748 --> 00:21:17,681
a dividend stream
from your equity share,

549
00:21:17,716 --> 00:21:18,982
a no-poaching commitment--

550
00:21:19,018 --> 00:21:19,983
And if the carrot
doesn't work,

551
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:21,485
you use the goddamn stick.

552
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,352
And threaten him with what?

553
00:21:22,388 --> 00:21:23,921
We took half the firm
from him.

554
00:21:23,956 --> 00:21:25,689
There is nothing left
to take.

555
00:21:28,928 --> 00:21:31,962
I'm sorry, Robert.

556
00:21:31,997 --> 00:21:33,130
I did everything I could.

557
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:35,098
We're gonna have to find
another way.

558
00:21:36,969 --> 00:21:38,847
Gentlemen, you have
five minutes to make your case.

559
00:21:38,871 --> 00:21:39,881
You don't, this will be
the shortest lunch

560
00:21:39,905 --> 00:21:42,673
in the history of lunches.
- Then I'll get to it.

561
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,175
We offered Simon Lowe
a settlement

562
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,011
no reasonable CEO
would refuse.

563
00:21:48,047 --> 00:21:51,615
So we want to see
if cooler heads can prevail.

564
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,849
This isn't about
cooler heads.

565
00:21:52,885 --> 00:21:56,653
This is about driving a wedge
between me and my CEO,

566
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:58,633
and that's not gonna happen.
- That's the thing, Elaine.

567
00:21:58,657 --> 00:21:59,957
There's no need
to drive a wedge,

568
00:21:59,992 --> 00:22:01,959
because it already exists.

569
00:22:01,994 --> 00:22:05,128
That is an email chain
between me and Simon

570
00:22:05,164 --> 00:22:06,029
from 18 months ago.

571
00:22:06,065 --> 00:22:07,965
As you can see,
he was looking

572
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,644
to relieve you of your duties
as chairwoman.

573
00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:11,101
I don't know about you,

574
00:22:11,136 --> 00:22:12,380
but if someone did that
to me at my firm,

575
00:22:12,404 --> 00:22:14,805
their ass would be on the
sidewalk ten seconds later.

576
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,806
And if this is true,

577
00:22:15,841 --> 00:22:17,874
why didn't you
bring it to my attention then?

578
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:18,842
Because unlike Simon,

579
00:22:18,877 --> 00:22:21,812
I'm loyal to the guy
who writes my checks.

580
00:22:21,847 --> 00:22:23,780
There's no two ways
about it, Elaine.

581
00:22:23,816 --> 00:22:24,614
Simon's a threat to you.

582
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,550
Daniel Hardman's
a threat to us.

583
00:22:26,585 --> 00:22:27,595
Do you want to neutralize
those threats,

584
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:28,485
or do you just want
to sit there eating salad

585
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,853
while they neutralize you?

586
00:22:33,993 --> 00:22:36,259
Gentlemen, I do believe
I'll bring this to the board

587
00:22:36,295 --> 00:22:38,662
and see if
we can't reach a deal.

588
00:22:38,697 --> 00:22:40,308
Just so we're clear,
this settlement doesn't close

589
00:22:40,332 --> 00:22:41,832
if you only let Simon go.

590
00:22:41,867 --> 00:22:43,166
Believe me, Mr. Specter,

591
00:22:43,202 --> 00:22:44,735
when the board hears
about all of this,

592
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,269
you won't have
to worry about Simon

593
00:22:46,305 --> 00:22:48,939
or Daniel Hardman
ever again.

594
00:22:48,974 --> 00:22:51,641
Robert!

595
00:22:51,677 --> 00:22:54,211
Long time, no chat.

596
00:22:54,246 --> 00:22:57,180
To be honest, I wasn't sure
they were gonna let me in.

597
00:22:59,151 --> 00:23:02,819
So I take it this means
you're accepting my offer.

598
00:23:02,855 --> 00:23:06,556
Well...I don't accept
opening bids,

599
00:23:06,592 --> 00:23:08,203
but if you want to tell me
what you need--

600
00:23:08,227 --> 00:23:10,961
God damn it.
She didn't tell you, did she?

601
00:23:10,996 --> 00:23:12,295
- Eric--
- No, don't.

602
00:23:12,331 --> 00:23:13,775
We worked together
20 years, all right?

603
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:14,998
I know when you're stalling.

604
00:23:15,034 --> 00:23:18,802
Samantha didn't tell you,
and now you're covering for her

605
00:23:18,837 --> 00:23:20,103
like you always do.

606
00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:22,139
All right, she didn't.

607
00:23:22,174 --> 00:23:24,141
So, what, you want to mock me,

608
00:23:24,176 --> 00:23:26,143
or you want to tell me
what it's gonna take?

609
00:23:26,178 --> 00:23:28,678
It's simple, really.

610
00:23:28,714 --> 00:23:31,615
Daniel Hardman's name
for yours.

611
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,117
- Excuse me?
- I said you retire,

612
00:23:34,153 --> 00:23:35,886
I take Daniel on as a partner,

613
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:38,955
and that is
take it or leave it.

614
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,359
All right.

615
00:23:42,394 --> 00:23:44,161
Let's get to it.

616
00:23:44,196 --> 00:23:45,762
What the ----
is your problem with me?

617
00:23:45,798 --> 00:23:47,197
- My problem?
- Yeah.

618
00:23:47,232 --> 00:23:48,698
Why'd you take my firm
from me?

619
00:23:48,734 --> 00:23:51,802
See, that--that right there!
That's my problem.

620
00:23:51,837 --> 00:23:53,770
All we ever heard
is that it was your firm,

621
00:23:53,806 --> 00:23:55,605
your name, your reputation.

622
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:56,885
You know, we had
a little something

623
00:23:56,909 --> 00:23:57,741
to do with it as well.

624
00:23:57,776 --> 00:23:59,309
You think
I didn't know that?

625
00:23:59,344 --> 00:24:00,911
You think I never
gave you credit?

626
00:24:00,946 --> 00:24:01,912
I think you never
let us forget

627
00:24:01,947 --> 00:24:04,247
that it was you that got
our names on the wall.

628
00:24:04,283 --> 00:24:06,983
I did put your names
on the wall!

629
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:09,197
And maybe if you were a little
more focused on the big picture

630
00:24:09,221 --> 00:24:10,987
than getting a pat
on your back--

631
00:24:11,023 --> 00:24:12,133
Well, you never had a problem
giving a pat on the back

632
00:24:12,157 --> 00:24:14,825
to your little protégé.
- Don't you talk about her.

633
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,826
We would have never
gotten this place

634
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:18,829
if it wasn't for Samantha.
- So you always say.

635
00:24:18,864 --> 00:24:20,363
Although you never
quite say how.

636
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:22,099
But if I had
to venture a guess--

637
00:24:22,134 --> 00:24:23,733
Not another word, Eric.

638
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:25,180
If that's how you
really feel about me,

639
00:24:25,204 --> 00:24:27,537
the answer is no!

640
00:24:27,573 --> 00:24:30,040
I'll take my chances
with my friend!

641
00:24:30,075 --> 00:24:33,110
If you're talking about
Ellen, Ellen's not your friend.

642
00:24:33,145 --> 00:24:35,412
I'm talking about
Daniel Hardman.

643
00:24:35,447 --> 00:24:37,914
Mark my words, we'll come
to some accommodation,

644
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,418
and then you and Ellen Rand
can kiss my black ass.

645
00:24:47,726 --> 00:24:49,025
Well, I don't know about you,

646
00:24:49,061 --> 00:24:50,205
but I think we've earned
a drink.

647
00:24:50,229 --> 00:24:51,695
Well, I'd pour you one,
Louis,

648
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,296
but I'm fresh out
of Peachtree Schnapps.

649
00:24:53,332 --> 00:24:54,798
All right,
enough messing around.

650
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,133
What's the big news?

651
00:24:56,168 --> 00:24:57,968
We got the suit dismissed,

652
00:24:58,003 --> 00:25:00,070
and Daniel Hardman
is out of the picture.

653
00:25:00,105 --> 00:25:02,239
- Louis, that's great news.
- I just wish I could see

654
00:25:02,274 --> 00:25:03,874
the look on his face
when he finds out

655
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:06,042
we got the better of him.
- I hate to break it to you,

656
00:25:06,078 --> 00:25:06,877
but you didn't get
the better of anybody.

657
00:25:06,912 --> 00:25:07,956
Robert, what are you
doing here?

658
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,124
More importantly,
what are you talking about?

659
00:25:09,148 --> 00:25:11,681
I knew what you were
up against,

660
00:25:11,717 --> 00:25:13,283
so I went to Daniel as a friend

661
00:25:13,318 --> 00:25:15,152
and offered him a deal.
- What kind of deal?

662
00:25:15,187 --> 00:25:16,931
I know what kind of deal,
because there's only one thing

663
00:25:16,955 --> 00:25:19,723
that son of a bitch would
trade taking me down for,

664
00:25:19,758 --> 00:25:21,725
and he told me what it is:
his name on our wall.

665
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,160
And I would never
give him that.

666
00:25:23,195 --> 00:25:25,328
It doesn't matter now,
because...

667
00:25:25,364 --> 00:25:27,264
when Daniel heard
that Simon got fired,

668
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:29,410
he thought I was playing him,
and he pulled the trigger

669
00:25:29,434 --> 00:25:31,401
on an ethics hearing.

670
00:25:31,436 --> 00:25:33,904
What the shit
did you just say?

671
00:25:33,939 --> 00:25:36,239
They set the date, Louis.

672
00:25:36,275 --> 00:25:38,008
When?

673
00:25:38,043 --> 00:25:41,011
- Harvey, before--
- When, Alex?

674
00:25:41,046 --> 00:25:42,512
This says the hearing's
tomorrow.

675
00:25:42,548 --> 00:25:44,014
They're summoning you,
me, Simon,

676
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:45,360
Thomas, and Donna.
- Which means we have

677
00:25:45,384 --> 00:25:46,995
less than 24 hours
to get our story straight,

678
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:47,951
convince Thomas
to corroborate it,

679
00:25:47,986 --> 00:25:51,021
and get Donna
the fuck out of town.

680
00:25:51,056 --> 00:25:52,155
It's not gonna work, Louis.

681
00:25:52,191 --> 00:25:53,523
Leave me alone, all of you.

682
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:55,125
- I need time to think.
- Harvey--

683
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,260
I don't want to talk
about it, Robert.

684
00:25:57,296 --> 00:25:59,863
You know, I don't care
if one day,

685
00:25:59,898 --> 00:26:02,332
they get me on any of
the other shit that I've done,

686
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:04,334
but to go down for this?

687
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:05,468
To go down to <i>him?</i>

688
00:26:05,504 --> 00:26:07,103
- Harvey, we can still--
- No, we can't!

689
00:26:07,139 --> 00:26:08,183
Look, he's got me
dead to rights.

690
00:26:08,207 --> 00:26:10,874
Mike was dead to rights.
Look what happened to him.

691
00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:13,276
This isn't a jury.
It's a fucking ethics board.

692
00:26:13,312 --> 00:26:15,212
And I did exactly
what he said I did.

693
00:26:15,247 --> 00:26:16,947
- Harvey--
- Motherfucker!

694
00:26:22,254 --> 00:26:24,387
I said leave me alone.

695
00:26:43,111 --> 00:26:46,513
I know I'm interrupting,
but can I come in?

696
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:48,082
Why not?

697
00:26:48,117 --> 00:26:50,784
Sitting by myself doesn't seem
to be getting me anywhere.

698
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,755
Well...maybe this will.

699
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,957
Technically...

700
00:26:56,993 --> 00:26:59,593
You did not break privilege
when you told Donna.

701
00:26:59,629 --> 00:27:02,563
In other words, I could
throw Donna under the bus.

702
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:05,099
I know you won't do it.

703
00:27:05,134 --> 00:27:06,867
But it had to be said.

704
00:27:08,638 --> 00:27:10,871
Then it's been said.

705
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:14,875
What?

706
00:27:14,911 --> 00:27:16,243
If this were
another firm,

707
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:18,746
she wouldn't even
still be working here.

708
00:27:18,781 --> 00:27:20,948
You saying
we should fire her?

709
00:27:20,983 --> 00:27:22,261
If you're asking me
as a name partner,

710
00:27:22,285 --> 00:27:24,752
I would say yes.

711
00:27:24,787 --> 00:27:26,754
If you're asking me
as her friend,

712
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:28,322
I would say...

713
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:31,926
There's no way in hell I am
ever letting that woman go.

714
00:27:31,961 --> 00:27:33,327
Never thought
in a million years

715
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:35,107
something like that
could come out of your mouth.

716
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:39,233
Well, maybe this place
is rubbing off on me.

717
00:27:39,268 --> 00:27:41,835
You are all...crazy.

718
00:27:41,871 --> 00:27:44,171
But...

719
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:47,241
maybe that's what
I love about it here.

720
00:27:56,986 --> 00:28:00,087
He's gonna lose everything
because of me.

721
00:28:00,122 --> 00:28:03,357
Donna...you never know
how these hearings will go.

722
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:05,759
You know...
the worst part is,

723
00:28:05,795 --> 00:28:09,330
I don't even know
why I did it anymore.

724
00:28:09,365 --> 00:28:11,765
I didn't sleep that night.
I just lay there wondering,

725
00:28:11,801 --> 00:28:13,600
"What if Harvey
can't get it done?"

726
00:28:13,636 --> 00:28:15,681
And then I would tell myself,
"Well, he always gets it done."

727
00:28:15,705 --> 00:28:18,038
And then it was morning,
and I hadn't heard from him,

728
00:28:18,074 --> 00:28:19,974
and Thomas' business
was at stake, and I just--

729
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:22,109
Donna, you told him
because you love him.

730
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,811
Love him?

731
00:28:23,846 --> 00:28:25,612
We just started
seeing each other.

732
00:28:25,648 --> 00:28:27,815
I'm not talking
about Thomas.

733
00:28:30,186 --> 00:28:31,885
Third year of law school.

734
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:35,189
Rosalie went behind my back
about a pro Bono we were doing.

735
00:28:35,224 --> 00:28:37,725
We got in a huge fight,
and it broke us up,

736
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,726
'cause I thought
she betrayed me,

737
00:28:38,761 --> 00:28:41,695
and she thought I thought
I was a better lawyer.

738
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:44,331
But she didn't betray me, and
I didn't think I was better.

739
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:47,201
And none of that had anything
to do with it anyway.

740
00:28:47,236 --> 00:28:49,336
What does this
have to do with me?

741
00:28:49,372 --> 00:28:51,839
I was afraid of committing.

742
00:28:51,874 --> 00:28:54,742
Deep down, she knew it,
so she closed the window.

743
00:28:54,777 --> 00:28:56,243
And it made me realize

744
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:59,179
I didn't like being
on the other side of the glass.

745
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:03,050
I didn't do what I did to
make Harvey realize anything.

746
00:29:03,085 --> 00:29:04,752
Neither did Rosalie.

747
00:29:04,787 --> 00:29:06,854
She did it
so she could move on.

748
00:29:10,726 --> 00:29:12,326
<i>Thomas, I appreciate you</i>
<i>seeing me</i>

749
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:13,761
<i>on such short notice.</i>

750
00:29:13,796 --> 00:29:14,661
You said it was about Donna,

751
00:29:14,697 --> 00:29:16,430
so of course I'll see you.

752
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:19,066
- What's going on?
- It's simple.

753
00:29:19,101 --> 00:29:22,236
Donna was the one
who told you about Simon...

754
00:29:22,271 --> 00:29:24,271
but I want you
to say it was me.

755
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:26,206
You want me to lie.

756
00:29:26,242 --> 00:29:28,842
Look, I know
you're a man of your word,

757
00:29:28,878 --> 00:29:30,844
but she risked all this
because she knows

758
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,713
how much your business
means to you.

759
00:29:32,748 --> 00:29:34,882
Well, she worked
her entire life

760
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:37,751
to get to where she is,
and the truth comes out,

761
00:29:37,787 --> 00:29:39,297
she'll be barred
from working in a law firm

762
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:41,255
for the rest of her life.

763
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,290
What am I not seeing here,
Harvey?

764
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:44,858
How does all this protect you?

765
00:29:44,894 --> 00:29:46,393
It doesn't.

766
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:47,961
I just don't see
why she has to stand

767
00:29:47,997 --> 00:29:50,364
in front of
that firing squad too.

768
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,267
All I'm asking you to do

769
00:29:53,302 --> 00:29:55,402
is protect her...

770
00:29:55,438 --> 00:29:57,838
like she protected you.

771
00:29:59,241 --> 00:30:01,475
Oh, no, no, no.

772
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:04,078
You were the first one
to take an offer.

773
00:30:04,113 --> 00:30:05,979
Yeah, but then you
went to another firm.

774
00:30:06,015 --> 00:30:07,448
Because back then,

775
00:30:07,483 --> 00:30:09,416
they weren't gonna hire
a man like me,

776
00:30:09,452 --> 00:30:10,951
no matter what school
I went to.

777
00:30:10,986 --> 00:30:12,419
I could have got you in.

778
00:30:12,455 --> 00:30:13,987
They hired Jessica.

779
00:30:14,023 --> 00:30:17,124
Years later.
I couldn't wait for that.

780
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:20,327
I still think we would have
made a great firm.

781
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:21,562
Zane Hardman.

782
00:30:21,597 --> 00:30:22,741
Wait, why is your name first?

783
00:30:22,765 --> 00:30:24,832
You let Jessica go first.

784
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:26,934
You let Rand and Kaldor.

785
00:30:26,969 --> 00:30:28,001
Yeah, you're right.

786
00:30:28,037 --> 00:30:30,237
I don't have to go first.
I know where I stand.

787
00:30:30,272 --> 00:30:32,840
Go ahead, take it.
Hardman Zane.

788
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:34,108
No. I don't want it now.

789
00:30:35,044 --> 00:30:37,077
- Excuse me a moment, Daniel.
- Mm-hmm.

790
00:30:42,852 --> 00:30:43,951
Cameron?

791
00:30:43,986 --> 00:30:46,086
Robert, I have some news,

792
00:30:46,122 --> 00:30:48,422
and I thought
I owed it to you to call.

793
00:31:01,036 --> 00:31:04,037
Please don't tell her.

794
00:31:06,308 --> 00:31:07,207
Robert,
whatever it is,

795
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:10,777
- I have to testify this morning.
- I know.

796
00:31:10,813 --> 00:31:12,212
Then what is it?

797
00:31:12,248 --> 00:31:13,814
Remember when I said

798
00:31:13,849 --> 00:31:15,983
I couldn't make up
for what I did?

799
00:31:16,018 --> 00:31:17,851
I think I can.

800
00:31:17,887 --> 00:31:18,752
But I'm gonna need your help,

801
00:31:18,787 --> 00:31:22,022
and you might not like
what I need it for.

802
00:31:22,057 --> 00:31:22,956
Well, I know what it's like

803
00:31:22,992 --> 00:31:25,092
to live with a weight
on your shoulders.

804
00:31:25,127 --> 00:31:27,161
And if I can help you
take it off,

805
00:31:27,196 --> 00:31:30,230
why don't you go ahead
and tell me what you need?

806
00:31:34,103 --> 00:31:36,803
- Thomas.
- Can I come in?

807
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:38,138
Of course.

808
00:31:38,174 --> 00:31:39,484
I was just getting ready
for this morning.

809
00:31:39,508 --> 00:31:41,942
I know. That's what
I wanted to talk about.

810
00:31:43,712 --> 00:31:45,979
Look, if this is about Louis
coming to see you,

811
00:31:46,015 --> 00:31:47,915
if I had known
he was gonna do that--

812
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:48,916
It's not about Louis
coming to me.

813
00:31:48,951 --> 00:31:52,252
It's, um--it's about
Harvey Specter coming to me.

814
00:31:52,288 --> 00:31:55,222
- Harvey came to you?
- Last night.

815
00:31:55,257 --> 00:31:57,424
- What did he say?
- Well, he pretty much said

816
00:31:57,459 --> 00:31:59,059
that he was about
to lay himself down

817
00:31:59,094 --> 00:32:00,227
on the train tracks for you,

818
00:32:00,262 --> 00:32:04,264
and he wanted me
to help tie him down.

819
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,533
Well...
I-I don't know

820
00:32:06,569 --> 00:32:07,868
exactly what that means--

821
00:32:07,903 --> 00:32:09,369
Who are you to him?

822
00:32:11,874 --> 00:32:13,273
I don't know
how to answer that.

823
00:32:13,309 --> 00:32:15,976
I got it when Louis
came to me.

824
00:32:16,011 --> 00:32:16,977
This comes out,
it hurts his firm.

825
00:32:17,012 --> 00:32:17,778
It hurts his partner.

826
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:19,346
He wouldn't want
to see that happen.

827
00:32:19,381 --> 00:32:23,016
But then Harvey came to me,
and...

828
00:32:23,052 --> 00:32:25,085
all he seemed
to care about is you.

829
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,855
So if you can't tell me
who you are to him, maybe...

830
00:32:28,891 --> 00:32:33,026
you can tell me
who he is to you.

831
00:32:33,062 --> 00:32:35,162
I don't know
who he is, Thomas.

832
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,743
I just know
that he's somebody

833
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:42,102
that I can't seem to figure out
how to cut out of me.

834
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:47,708
But I want to.

835
00:32:47,743 --> 00:32:50,477
And I have wanted to,
and apparently, I tried to

836
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:52,879
when I told you
what was going on.

837
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,483
But the truth is,
I don't know

838
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:59,052
if I'll ever be able to.

839
00:33:03,992 --> 00:33:06,794
Thomas Kessler shook my hand
and said yes to a deal.

840
00:33:06,829 --> 00:33:09,263
He had no reason
in the world to back out

841
00:33:09,298 --> 00:33:11,966
until Harvey Specter
gave him one.

842
00:33:12,001 --> 00:33:12,867
When you confronted him
with this allegation,

843
00:33:12,902 --> 00:33:14,168
what did he do?

844
00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:17,104
He paid off my board
and got me fired.

845
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,072
It wasn't a payoff.

846
00:33:18,107 --> 00:33:19,940
It was a settlement
that we offered you first.

847
00:33:19,976 --> 00:33:20,986
Along with a fabricated
explanation

848
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,611
about Kessler finding out
due to a clerical error.

849
00:33:23,646 --> 00:33:26,147
The contents of that offer
are not admissible here.

850
00:33:26,182 --> 00:33:29,316
In other words, you're
preparing to change your story?

851
00:33:29,352 --> 00:33:30,818
As far as I'm concerned,

852
00:33:30,853 --> 00:33:32,653
it's time to get
to the main course.

853
00:33:32,688 --> 00:33:34,255
I call Harvey Specter.

854
00:33:35,858 --> 00:33:37,291
Where is she?

855
00:33:37,326 --> 00:33:39,138
She said she didn't care
if she was summoned or not.

856
00:33:39,162 --> 00:33:40,461
She couldn't watch.

857
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:42,797
What are you gonna do?

858
00:33:42,832 --> 00:33:44,732
I don't know.

859
00:33:44,767 --> 00:33:46,233
Shortly after Simon Lowe
told you

860
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:48,235
he was using Thomas Kessler
as a pawn,

861
00:33:48,271 --> 00:33:49,415
Kessler pulled out
of their deal.

862
00:33:49,439 --> 00:33:51,939
- Why was that?
- If you're asking

863
00:33:51,974 --> 00:33:54,942
if I told him about
my client's plans, I didn't.

864
00:33:54,977 --> 00:33:56,710
- Then how did he find out?
- I don't know.

865
00:33:56,746 --> 00:33:58,345
Maybe Restoration
clued him in.

866
00:33:58,381 --> 00:34:00,314
Maybe he overheard someone
at dinner.

867
00:34:00,349 --> 00:34:02,183
Or maybe it was
the clerical error nonsense

868
00:34:02,218 --> 00:34:04,852
you tried to pull before.
- What's nonsense is,

869
00:34:04,887 --> 00:34:07,588
I did not share my client's
privileged information

870
00:34:07,623 --> 00:34:10,157
with another client, yet...

871
00:34:10,193 --> 00:34:11,303
he brought
this complaint anyway,

872
00:34:11,327 --> 00:34:14,095
and he did it because
he knew Pierpont Malls

873
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,630
was about to drop their suit
against my firm

874
00:34:16,666 --> 00:34:17,998
because it had no merit.

875
00:34:18,034 --> 00:34:20,034
They dropped it
because you paid them to.

876
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:21,869
Mr. Specter,
Mr. Hardman has a point.

877
00:34:21,904 --> 00:34:23,348
I find it hard to believe
that Thomas Kessler

878
00:34:23,372 --> 00:34:25,106
wasn't informed by your office,

879
00:34:25,141 --> 00:34:27,875
so I ask you...
do you stand by your answer?

880
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:30,945
I stand by the fact that
he has to prove what I did.

881
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,713
I don't have to prove
what I didn't.

882
00:34:32,748 --> 00:34:36,016
Then I say it's time
we ask someone else.

883
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,621
Mr. Williams,
did you or did you not

884
00:34:40,656 --> 00:34:43,324
inform Thomas Kessler
that his firm was being used

885
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,059
as a stalking horse?

886
00:34:45,094 --> 00:34:46,227
No, I did not.

887
00:34:46,262 --> 00:34:47,862
Then is it true

888
00:34:47,897 --> 00:34:50,197
Mr. Kessler knew
he was being used?

889
00:34:50,233 --> 00:34:52,044
I can't speak to what
my client did or didn't know.

890
00:34:52,068 --> 00:34:53,245
Then let's talk
about what you knew.

891
00:34:53,269 --> 00:34:55,069
You got his original landlord

892
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,837
to make him a better offer,
did you not?

893
00:34:56,873 --> 00:34:59,006
Yes, I did. And there's
nothing wrong with using

894
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:00,719
Pierpont's offer to get
a better deal for my client.

895
00:35:00,743 --> 00:35:01,854
It's what
they were doing to us.

896
00:35:01,878 --> 00:35:03,978
Yes, but the difference is,
when he got the offer,

897
00:35:04,013 --> 00:35:06,213
he turned it down.
Why would he do that?

898
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,750
- Because...
- Because...

899
00:35:09,785 --> 00:35:10,651
what?

900
00:35:10,686 --> 00:35:12,231
Why would a man
turn down a better offer

901
00:35:12,255 --> 00:35:13,665
and then take out an ad
in the "Journal"

902
00:35:13,689 --> 00:35:16,223
pronouncing the value
of integrity

903
00:35:16,259 --> 00:35:17,858
over profits?

904
00:35:17,894 --> 00:35:19,760
It's because he knew

905
00:35:19,795 --> 00:35:22,163
what Simon Lowe was doing,
and you knew he knew.

906
00:35:22,198 --> 00:35:24,098
And I remind you,
I will call Thomas Kessler,

907
00:35:24,133 --> 00:35:25,366
and he will tell me the truth,

908
00:35:25,401 --> 00:35:27,668
because he is a man
of integrity.

909
00:35:27,703 --> 00:35:30,070
All right.
I knew.

910
00:35:30,106 --> 00:35:33,040
And I told my client,
which was my obligation.

911
00:35:33,075 --> 00:35:36,410
Finally. You knew...because
Harvey Specter told you.

912
00:35:36,445 --> 00:35:41,382
No. I knew because
Robert Zane told me.

913
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:42,761
What?
I can't cover for you anymore.

914
00:35:42,785 --> 00:35:43,795
You're not covering anything.

915
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:45,186
I had no reason
to break privilege.

916
00:35:45,221 --> 00:35:46,954
Yes, you did.

917
00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:48,100
You saw a way to get back at
Harvey Specter and Louis Litt

918
00:35:48,124 --> 00:35:50,124
for taking you down
as managing partner.

919
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:51,792
You knew if you
broke privilege,

920
00:35:51,827 --> 00:35:53,205
he would take a hit and you
would take the firm back.

921
00:35:53,229 --> 00:35:54,506
Mr. Chairman,
that is a fabrication.

922
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:57,298
This is obviously a hit job
on an innocent man.

923
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:58,265
If he's so innocent,

924
00:35:58,301 --> 00:35:59,378
then why do I have an email
from Robert Zane

925
00:35:59,402 --> 00:36:02,703
informing me of
Simon Lowe's duplicity?

926
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,440
- You're in on this?
- Mr. Zane.

927
00:36:06,475 --> 00:36:08,275
Is this true?

928
00:36:11,314 --> 00:36:12,980
It is.

929
00:36:13,015 --> 00:36:15,382
I can't hide it anymore.

930
00:36:15,418 --> 00:36:17,718
Oh, no.

931
00:36:17,753 --> 00:36:20,154
They orchestrated
this whole thing.

932
00:36:20,189 --> 00:36:21,989
Ask Kessler.

933
00:36:22,024 --> 00:36:23,424
Mr. Kessler, who was it,
Robert Zane

934
00:36:23,459 --> 00:36:25,960
or Harvey Specter?

935
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:32,166
All I know is that
Alex Williams

936
00:36:32,201 --> 00:36:33,834
informed me
of Pierpont's plan.

937
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:35,402
I can't speak
to who told him.

938
00:36:35,438 --> 00:36:38,005
No. Travis Tanner admitted

939
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,074
Harvey called him
the night before.

940
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:41,008
Then why isn't he here?

941
00:36:41,043 --> 00:36:44,178
Obviously
because he got to him!

942
00:36:44,213 --> 00:36:47,114
Robert, as this is
a disbarrable offense,

943
00:36:47,149 --> 00:36:49,183
I ask you again, under oath,

944
00:36:49,218 --> 00:36:51,085
is this email real?

945
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,486
Did you do this?

946
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,070
I did.

947
00:37:02,206 --> 00:37:05,374
Then do you have anything
to say in your defense?

948
00:37:05,409 --> 00:37:08,210
Only that I did
what I felt

949
00:37:08,245 --> 00:37:10,045
was right at the time.

950
00:37:10,081 --> 00:37:12,881
I didn't regret it then.

951
00:37:12,917 --> 00:37:14,883
But I do now.

952
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:17,653
Robert,
why are you doing this?

953
00:37:20,992 --> 00:37:23,225
I'm making up
for what I did wrong.

954
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,162
Well, I'm sorry to say,
but that's not enough.

955
00:37:27,198 --> 00:37:29,531
You hereby forfeit your
license to practice law.

956
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:32,067
This matter's now closed.

957
00:37:45,883 --> 00:37:47,383
How could you do it?

958
00:37:47,418 --> 00:37:48,283
- Samantha.
- You've been working

959
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:49,084
your whole life for this.

960
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,819
How could you just
throw it away?

961
00:37:50,855 --> 00:37:51,620
I didn't throw it away.

962
00:37:51,656 --> 00:37:52,621
That's what I need you
to understand.

963
00:37:52,657 --> 00:37:54,289
Well, I don't understand it.

964
00:37:54,325 --> 00:37:57,826
How could you take the fall
for something you didn't do?

965
00:37:57,862 --> 00:37:58,994
How could you do that to me?

966
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,462
Because I did something else,

967
00:38:00,498 --> 00:38:01,830
and I can't live with it
anymore.

968
00:38:01,866 --> 00:38:03,232
What are you
talking about?

969
00:38:03,267 --> 00:38:06,001
That man that attacked you...

970
00:38:06,037 --> 00:38:07,503
the one that we put away--

971
00:38:07,538 --> 00:38:09,938
That's why you did this?

972
00:38:09,974 --> 00:38:12,274
Robert, he got
what he deserved.

973
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:15,110
He was killed, Samantha,

974
00:38:15,146 --> 00:38:16,845
murdered in his own cell.

975
00:38:16,881 --> 00:38:19,048
And it's my fault.

976
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:20,916
Now, he may have been
a piece of shit,

977
00:38:20,951 --> 00:38:22,051
but he was someone's son,

978
00:38:22,086 --> 00:38:25,354
and he wouldn't have been
in there if it weren't for me.

979
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:27,022
Why didn't you tell me?

980
00:38:27,058 --> 00:38:29,058
Because it wasn't
your burden to bear.

981
00:38:29,093 --> 00:38:31,126
But I am telling you now

982
00:38:31,162 --> 00:38:33,395
because I need you
to understand.

983
00:38:35,966 --> 00:38:38,600
This is redemption for me.

984
00:38:38,636 --> 00:38:41,603
What am I gonna do
without you?

985
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:43,138
You've got your name
on the wall.

986
00:38:43,174 --> 00:38:46,075
You don't need me
anymore.

987
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:49,545
The truth is...

988
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:53,082
you haven't needed me
for a long time.

989
00:39:00,357 --> 00:39:02,324
I don't want
to be alone.

990
00:39:02,359 --> 00:39:05,394
You're not gonna be
alone here.

991
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:09,431
You've got...
Louis and Donna and Alex.

992
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:10,899
It's not the same thing.

993
00:39:10,935 --> 00:39:12,301
Ha-ha. You want
to talk the same?

994
00:39:12,336 --> 00:39:14,403
I've seen you
and Harvey together.

995
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:17,272
You're peas in a pod.

996
00:39:17,308 --> 00:39:20,409
Go to him.
Seek him out.

997
00:39:21,512 --> 00:39:24,179
And who knows?
Over time,

998
00:39:24,215 --> 00:39:28,117
you might even...

999
00:39:28,152 --> 00:39:29,618
Might even what?

1000
00:39:31,489 --> 00:39:33,255
Nothing.

1001
00:39:36,994 --> 00:39:39,128
Now come over here
and give an old man a hug.

1002
00:39:53,043 --> 00:39:54,676
You looking for him too?

1003
00:39:57,681 --> 00:40:00,215
I went to call Donna
after the hearing.

1004
00:40:00,251 --> 00:40:03,051
She didn't answer,
but when I came back,

1005
00:40:03,087 --> 00:40:04,686
all you guys were gone.

1006
00:40:04,722 --> 00:40:07,122
There wasn't really
a reason to stay.

1007
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:11,527
Alex, if you'd have told me
you were gonna do that--

1008
00:40:11,562 --> 00:40:14,329
That's why Robert
wouldn't let me tell you.

1009
00:40:15,933 --> 00:40:17,399
I know I need
to thank him...

1010
00:40:17,434 --> 00:40:20,402
- But you need to know why.
- Yeah.

1011
00:40:20,437 --> 00:40:22,404
- I do.
- Because, Harvey,

1012
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:24,184
sometimes people
are carrying around a burden

1013
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:27,376
they need to put down that
has nothing to do with you.

1014
00:40:27,411 --> 00:40:28,310
What burden?

1015
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:30,179
None of your
goddamn business.

1016
00:40:30,214 --> 00:40:32,714
Stop moping around
my office.

1017
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,249
I'm retired.

1018
00:40:34,285 --> 00:40:36,318
I'm not dead.

1019
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:37,553
And, Harvey...

1020
00:40:37,588 --> 00:40:40,255
I knew what I was doing.

1021
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:42,157
I'm good with it.

1022
00:40:43,694 --> 00:40:45,694
Well, then if it's
all right with you,

1023
00:40:45,729 --> 00:40:48,096
what do you say,
to celebrate your retirement,

1024
00:40:48,132 --> 00:40:50,365
I finally take you out
for that burger?

1025
00:40:50,401 --> 00:40:52,601
You got it.

1026
00:40:52,636 --> 00:40:54,503
But not tonight.

1027
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:57,072
Something like this happens,

1028
00:40:57,107 --> 00:41:00,008
makes you know
what's really important.

1029
00:41:00,044 --> 00:41:02,511
And for me, it's Laura.

1030
00:41:05,049 --> 00:41:07,382
Hey.

1031
00:41:07,418 --> 00:41:09,618
You sure you don't want to
tell me what that burden was?

1032
00:41:09,653 --> 00:41:12,788
Isn't it enough
I saved your sorry ass?

1033
00:41:12,823 --> 00:41:15,591
And by the way,
most people get a gold watch.

1034
00:41:15,626 --> 00:41:17,926
I get a goddamn burger.

1035
00:41:20,297 --> 00:41:22,231
Why you gotta push it?

1036
00:41:22,266 --> 00:41:24,766
Now we gotta get him a watch.

1037
00:41:24,802 --> 00:41:26,401
Hey.

1038
00:41:26,437 --> 00:41:28,303
u want to get a burger?

1039
00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:30,572
Sorry, Harvey.

1040
00:41:30,608 --> 00:41:32,441
Robert's right.

1041
00:41:32,476 --> 00:41:35,611
I need to get home
to the woman I love.

1042
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,757
Shouldn't you be out
celebrating?

1043
00:41:48,792 --> 00:41:51,260
You'd think so,
but losing Robert

1044
00:41:51,295 --> 00:41:54,162
kind of takes the charm
off the victory.

1045
00:41:57,201 --> 00:41:59,134
Listen, Harvey,

1046
00:41:59,169 --> 00:42:00,769
I appreciate this,
but...

1047
00:42:00,804 --> 00:42:04,072
I don't need you
checking up on me.

1048
00:42:04,108 --> 00:42:06,108
Where else
do I have to be?

1049
00:42:10,114 --> 00:42:12,781
You know,
I lost my mentor too.

1050
00:42:12,816 --> 00:42:15,117
Jessica Pearson.

1051
00:42:15,152 --> 00:42:17,486
Robert used to talk
about her all the time.

1052
00:42:17,521 --> 00:42:19,554
What was she like?

1053
00:42:21,558 --> 00:42:24,526
Let's just say she was to me
what he is to you.

1054
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:27,462
It was hard losing her,
but...

1055
00:42:27,498 --> 00:42:29,097
it gets easier.

1056
00:42:30,534 --> 00:42:33,635
He believed in me.

1057
00:42:33,671 --> 00:42:35,704
He was the only one

1058
00:42:35,739 --> 00:42:37,472
who ever did that.

1059
00:42:37,508 --> 00:42:40,375
The only one
who saw who I was.

1060
00:42:40,411 --> 00:42:43,645
All my baggage,
all my flaws.

1061
00:42:43,681 --> 00:42:45,547
And he accepted you
anyway.

1062
00:42:45,582 --> 00:42:48,550
He didn't just accept me.

1063
00:42:48,585 --> 00:42:50,319
He loved me.

1064
00:42:50,354 --> 00:42:53,355
Not easy to find someone
like that in this world.

1065
00:42:54,692 --> 00:42:56,458
No, it's not.

1066
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:58,961
I mean, what am I
supposed to do when I have

1067
00:42:58,996 --> 00:43:00,295
a big victory
or a terrible loss

1068
00:43:00,331 --> 00:43:04,333
and the only person I want
to run and tell isn't there?

1069
00:43:04,368 --> 00:43:06,635
What am I supposed to do?

1070
00:43:08,739 --> 00:43:11,139
Samantha, I'm so sorry,
but I have to go.

1071
00:43:11,175 --> 00:43:13,575
Where?

1072
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:15,911
I just have to.
