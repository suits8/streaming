1
00:00:00,013 --> 00:00:01,101
<i>Previously, on</i>
"Suits"...

2
00:00:01,137 --> 00:00:02,974
You're afraid she won't
have time for the baby.

3
00:00:03,059 --> 00:00:04,169
I don't know
how it's gonna work.

4
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,903
When the time comes,
you'll be able to step back little

5
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:09,512
and trust that the firm's
in good hands.

6
00:00:09,598 --> 00:00:12,496
We pushed the price back down
to what Teddy sold it for.

7
00:00:12,582 --> 00:00:13,996
We get Stu Buzzini to help us.

8
00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:15,184
Putting downward pressure

9
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,682
on a stock to help a takeover
attempt is illegal.

10
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:18,965
We can't ask Stu.
to do that.

11
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:20,363
- Although, I'm...
- Sure you wanna do this?

12
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:22,794
I'm sure, someone's gonna to do it,
whether I like it or not.

13
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,832
You wanted to
be what they wanted,

14
00:00:24,926 --> 00:00:26,779
- so they would choose you.
- They can't choose you.

15
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:28,317
They've already chosen
someone else.

16
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:29,676
This deposition is over.

17
00:00:29,825 --> 00:00:31,371
I have no idea
who my parents were.

18
00:00:31,457 --> 00:00:33,168
I bounced around
foster care system.

19
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:35,473
What does that have to do...
I helped you because

20
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:36,949
I would've given anything

21
00:00:37,035 --> 00:00:38,755
to have someone like you
looking out for me.

22
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:40,629
If you short that stock,
you make a fortune.

23
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:42,379
A good man will get
his company back.

24
00:00:42,465 --> 00:00:44,965
You guarantee I'm gonna make money
and not get caught?

25
00:00:45,051 --> 00:00:46,957
- What're we gonna do?
- I dunno.

26
00:00:47,043 --> 00:00:49,035
But you can't be
my associate anymore.

27
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:50,950
I don't wanna wait
three days to call you.

28
00:00:51,036 --> 00:00:53,637
- Can tomorrow be three days?
- What about date to tonight?

29
00:00:53,723 --> 00:00:54,996
And you come on up?

30
00:01:02,981 --> 00:01:05,699
- Hi. You're up.
- Been up for a while.

31
00:01:05,793 --> 00:01:08,184
Hope you don't mind, uh-yeah,
I made us coffee.

32
00:01:10,444 --> 00:01:11,762
What?

33
00:01:12,168 --> 00:01:13,707
Too presumptuous,
right?

34
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,658
I was just thinking...

35
00:01:16,903 --> 00:01:18,739
last night
was really nice.

36
00:01:18,825 --> 00:01:19,995
It was.

37
00:01:24,996 --> 00:01:27,207
And this is really nice
too.

38
00:01:28,043 --> 00:01:29,223
It is.

39
00:01:31,965 --> 00:01:33,840
As much as I'd love to spend
all morning with you,

40
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:35,590
I've got a big meeting.

41
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,387
We're actually expanding
our retail presence...

42
00:01:38,707 --> 00:01:41,637
- I get it. You have to go.
- I do.

43
00:01:41,723 --> 00:01:43,442
You remember
what I said last night,

44
00:01:43,528 --> 00:01:44,840
about not waiting
three days?

45
00:01:44,934 --> 00:01:46,801
I'd love to go out again,
Thomas.

46
00:01:46,918 --> 00:01:48,105
Is tonight too soon?

47
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:50,567
Let me check my calendar...
Yep, I'm free.

48
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:52,192
Heh. I'm gonna head out.

49
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,637
And do you mind
letting yourself out,

50
00:01:55,723 --> 00:01:58,028
because I was up
really late last night

51
00:01:58,114 --> 00:02:00,371
with this handsome man
that I just started seeing.

52
00:02:00,457 --> 00:02:02,489
I might just go back
to sleep.

53
00:02:02,887 --> 00:02:04,660
I don't mind at all.

54
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:10,371
Sweet dreams.

55
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:28,557
Judy.

56
00:02:28,746 --> 00:02:30,348
Oh, my God.

57
00:02:30,738 --> 00:02:31,957
It's been years.

58
00:02:32,043 --> 00:02:33,152
I know.

59
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:35,402
But you've never left
my thoughts.

60
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:38,656
Side effect of being a mother,
foster or not.

61
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,533
Well, it's great to see you.

62
00:02:40,832 --> 00:02:42,816
Let's get some breakfast.
I'll put my day on hold.

63
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:45,918
I'd love to, but the truth is,
I don't have time.

64
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:47,848
I'm here
because I need your help.

65
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,809
Come on in.
I'll make us some coffee.

66
00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:51,402
You can tell me
what you need.

67
00:02:53,363 --> 00:02:55,652
I know you said
you wanted an animal theme

68
00:02:55,738 --> 00:02:56,632
for the nursery,

69
00:02:56,793 --> 00:03:00,426
so I was thinking,
what about Peter Rabbit?

70
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:02,582
Or Paddington Bear?

71
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:06,129
Or we could just do
all football.

72
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:08,691
And baseball.
All sports.

73
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:10,254
Even wrestling.

74
00:03:10,706 --> 00:03:12,004
Love it. Sounds great.

75
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,894
You're not listening,
are you?

76
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,043
Sheila, I'm sorry. I just...
I just got an e-mail

77
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:19,598
that Katrina and Brian
shit the bed in a deposition,

78
00:03:19,684 --> 00:03:21,323
and I...

79
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:23,410
I know you're busier
than ever.

80
00:03:23,496 --> 00:03:26,119
But this baby's coming,
whether we're ready or not.

81
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,749
And I need you
to be fully here,

82
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:31,916
not just physically here.

83
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:34,332
- I promise, I will do better.
- Good.

84
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:37,496
Then we can decide on Peter Rabbit
and Paddington Bear

85
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:39,293
- with the designer tonight.
- Tonight?

86
00:03:39,465 --> 00:03:41,355
We set it last week.
Is that a problem?

87
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:42,582
No, tonight's perfect.

88
00:03:42,668 --> 00:03:43,721
Good.

89
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,676
And, honey, whatever's going on
with Katrina,

90
00:03:46,762 --> 00:03:48,351
I'm sure
there's a good reason.

91
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:56,066
One of my kids got pulled over
while driving my car.

92
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,746
He's a good kid.

93
00:03:58,312 --> 00:03:59,603
He reminds me of you,

94
00:03:59,785 --> 00:04:00,988
in more ways than one.

95
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,490
I get the picture.
What happened?

96
00:04:03,738 --> 00:04:05,871
There were some pills
in the car.

97
00:04:06,243 --> 00:04:07,848
And they arrested him.

98
00:04:08,574 --> 00:04:10,090
So he needs a lawyer.

99
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,801
He doesn't. I do.

100
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:12,888
What are you
talking about?

101
00:04:12,973 --> 00:04:14,926
I told the police
the pills were mine.

102
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:16,285
How could you do that?

103
00:04:16,371 --> 00:04:18,090
When my back
started acting up,

104
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:20,019
I had to cut down
on my hours at school.

105
00:04:20,105 --> 00:04:23,566
Corey figured it out,
so he started selling pills.

106
00:04:23,652 --> 00:04:26,746
And he used every penny
for groceries, or gas,

107
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:28,520
anything to help us get by.

108
00:04:28,652 --> 00:04:29,769
Judy, I'm not sure

109
00:04:29,855 --> 00:04:32,019
- I should get involved in this.
- Why not?

110
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,668
You're telling me
you didn't do this.

111
00:04:33,754 --> 00:04:37,996
And you want me not to use that.
If you want,

112
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:41,324
I can refer you to someone.
No one else can understand

113
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,980
what's at stake for Corey
and the rest of the kids.

114
00:04:44,136 --> 00:04:46,129
Because if that prosecutor
has her way,

115
00:04:46,215 --> 00:04:48,332
then I'm gonna lose
my fostering license,

116
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:49,832
and they'll take my kids
away.

117
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:51,902
- I understand that, but...
- Please.

118
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:54,355
I lost you
all those years ago.

119
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:58,770
And I have never regretted
anything more.

120
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:02,449
I can't let something like that
happen again.

What are you doing
on our side of town?

134
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:45,036
Waiting for you to come out.
'Cause I didn't want

135
00:05:45,121 --> 00:05:47,043
to have this conversation
in your office.

136
00:05:47,152 --> 00:05:48,926
You're gonna wanna
take a look at this.

137
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,473
What is it?

138
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,786
Remember that trade
you had me make

139
00:05:51,871 --> 00:05:53,363
to tank Doyle Shoes'
stock price?

140
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:55,551
I get it.
Someone figured it out.

141
00:05:55,637 --> 00:05:57,160
Now they want to use it
against you.

142
00:05:57,246 --> 00:05:58,973
Not just someone,
a trader at my firm.

143
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:01,473
He knows what he's doing.
And now he wants my job.

144
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:02,613
Or what?

145
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,035
Or he goes to the SEC.

146
00:06:04,121 --> 00:06:05,629
Once they start
an investigation...

147
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:07,832
- I know.
- Harvey, what are we gonna do?

148
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:10,707
Two things. First,
you're gonna hire a consultant,

149
00:06:10,793 --> 00:06:13,324
to review your firm's
risk tolerance policy.

150
00:06:13,418 --> 00:06:14,636
And second?

151
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:17,590
You can tell me everything there is
to know about this trader.

152
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:19,090
How old he is, how tall he is,

153
00:06:19,176 --> 00:06:20,685
what he eats for
breakfast in the morning.

154
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,044
What do you need
to know all that for?

155
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:23,520
Because he's got you,

156
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,762
which means I'm gonna have
to bluff him.

157
00:06:26,082 --> 00:06:27,699
And the best way
to bluff someone

158
00:06:27,785 --> 00:06:31,277
is to know more about him
than he knows about himself.

159
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,418
And who's this consultant
you want me to hire?

160
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:35,871
Let's just say
I got the perfect guy.

161
00:06:38,474 --> 00:06:40,769
Louis, how are you
this fine morning?

162
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:43,044
Don't give me that crap.
We don't want to spy on you and Brian

163
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:44,442
shit the bed
on your perfume case?

164
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:46,778
Louis, it's complicated,
but I've got it handled.

165
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,618
I thought
this was you and Brian.

166
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:49,961
Well, about that.

167
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:51,212
Brian and I...

168
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:52,616
Brian and you what?

169
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,594
Well, I think
that this case calls

170
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:58,596
for more expertise
than Brian can offer.

171
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:00,890
I was wondering if you'd
be able to help me.

172
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,160
Katrina,
I just asked Samantha

173
00:07:03,246 --> 00:07:04,955
to take a new client meeting
for me.

174
00:07:05,047 --> 00:07:07,840
I told Sheila I'd help
pick furniture for the nursery.

175
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:10,168
I have a million other things,
I'm trying to balance.

176
00:07:10,254 --> 00:07:12,723
And you were the one who said
that I had people

177
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:14,779
who could step up
if I needed to take a step back,

178
00:07:14,864 --> 00:07:15,957
were you not?

179
00:07:16,043 --> 00:07:18,598
- Yes, Louis, I was.
- Then you step the hell up.

180
00:07:18,684 --> 00:07:20,976
'Cause I don't want the world
to think we can't handle

181
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:22,770
a simple infringement case.

182
00:07:27,783 --> 00:07:30,176
There you are.
Donna, we need to talk.

183
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:31,629
Okay. About what?

184
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:32,926
For starters...

185
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:34,169
I've been looking for you
all morning.

186
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,917
Hi, if you must know...

187
00:07:37,965 --> 00:07:39,426
I overslept.

188
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:41,691
Why? What's going on?

189
00:07:42,184 --> 00:07:44,824
I need to know exactly
what you said to Stu

190
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,832
when we made that
Teddy Doyle trade last year.

191
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:48,061
Well, if I recall, I told him

192
00:07:48,146 --> 00:07:49,524
he wouldn't gonna be a
gunslinger for long

193
00:07:49,609 --> 00:07:52,262
- if he didn't do it. Why?
- See, you made sure he knew the risks?

194
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:53,551
I didn't have to make sure.

195
00:07:53,637 --> 00:07:56,070
He knew before have the words
were out of my mouth.

196
00:07:56,156 --> 00:07:58,676
- So once again, why?
- He's being blackmailed for it.

197
00:07:58,762 --> 00:08:01,035
Holy shit. Now how you're planning
to get him out of this?

198
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,629
'Cause, Harvey,
we have to get him out of it.

199
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:04,432
I know.
But I need to know

200
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:06,557
who lost,
and how much they lost,

201
00:08:06,643 --> 00:08:09,401
- on the other side of that trade.
- Wait. What?

202
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:12,018
I need to know
how badly Stu can get burned

203
00:08:12,104 --> 00:08:13,721
if this guy ends up
turning him in.

204
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:15,135
Okay.

205
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:16,903
I'll take care of that.

206
00:08:18,345 --> 00:08:20,909
Harvey, if this is about
getting financial information,

207
00:08:20,995 --> 00:08:22,264
Louis is the logical choice.

208
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:24,393
Look. I know
he's the managing partner,

209
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,769
and we should tell him.
But I don't want him involved

210
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,081
- unless there's no way out of it.
- Then I know who to go to.

211
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:39,706
Robert,
can I talk to you?

212
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:41,276
- It's important.
- Of course.

213
00:08:41,362 --> 00:08:42,866
I'd say good morning,
but I can see

214
00:08:42,952 --> 00:08:44,163
it hasn't been good for you.

215
00:08:44,268 --> 00:08:47,495
'Cause, Judy O'Brien came to my place
as I was headed in this morning.

216
00:08:47,581 --> 00:08:50,221
- Judy? Your old foster mom?
- That's the one.

217
00:08:50,385 --> 00:08:53,295
She's asked me to represent
her on a drug case.

218
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,651
She's innocent.

219
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:56,901
It's one of her kids
who's guilty.

220
00:08:57,026 --> 00:08:58,843
She won't let me tell
the prosecutor that.

221
00:08:58,928 --> 00:09:01,152
Samantha, as I recall,
this is the woman that took you in

222
00:09:01,237 --> 00:09:02,527
when you were 12 years old.

223
00:09:02,682 --> 00:09:05,198
She stuck with me, no matter
how much trouble I got in.

224
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:08,937
Till I blew it,
and the state took me away.

225
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:10,262
Then why won't you help her?

226
00:09:10,364 --> 00:09:11,773
Because what if...?

227
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:14,231
Samantha, I didn't handle
my sister's case

228
00:09:14,317 --> 00:09:15,985
because I was afraid.

229
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:18,237
And I've regretted
that decision ever since.

230
00:09:18,322 --> 00:09:22,012
Well, if Judy goes to prison because
of me, I'll regret that forever.

231
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:23,614
If she goes
because she told you

232
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,731
not to tell them the truth,
it's on her, not you.

233
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:28,097
- All the same.
- No, it's not all the same.

234
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,416
Samantha,
when you care about someone,

235
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:31,973
you fight twice as hard.

236
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:34,115
It's the reason
she came to you.

237
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,692
If it were me,

238
00:09:35,778 --> 00:09:37,145
I wouldn't
turn her away.

239
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:39,098
Okay.

240
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:42,511
Louis asked me
to take a meeting tonight.

241
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:44,317
I can't be in two places
at once.

242
00:09:44,403 --> 00:09:46,864
Give me the details,
and I'll take it for you.

243
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,101
And, Samantha...

244
00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:54,864
I'm proud of you
for doing this.

245
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:01,309
Mr. Stockman.
Yes, that's me.

246
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:03,418
Nick Pavonotti.
I was told to see you.

247
00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:05,568
I understand, you're doing
some consulting for the firm.

248
00:10:05,653 --> 00:10:09,262
That's right. And I started
looking at your trade history.

249
00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:11,373
Gen Biotech,
you lost 2 million.

250
00:10:11,497 --> 00:10:13,960
Shale Futures,
10 million down the drain.

251
00:10:14,137 --> 00:10:16,168
Ridley Pharma, same thing.
We make bets,

252
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:18,379
and sometimes you win,
sometimes you lose.

253
00:10:18,465 --> 00:10:20,512
Well, you're about to make
your worst bet yet.

254
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:22,965
What you're talking about?
You can after rethink your choice

255
00:10:23,051 --> 00:10:24,231
to go after Stu Buzzini.

256
00:10:24,317 --> 00:10:26,762
You're no fucking consultant.
You're right.

257
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,043
Then, you pursue this, Stu's not
gonna be the one in trouble.

258
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,590
- You are.
- What I got on Stu is real.

259
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:36,082
- That's why you're here.
- Doesn't matter what you have.

260
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,520
Half the guys on Wall Street
make dirty trades.

261
00:10:38,606 --> 00:10:41,348
And they see you throwing
one of their own under the bus,

262
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:42,989
they'll never wanna work
with you.

263
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:44,754
Something else
about Wall Street guys:

264
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:47,637
They're more loyal to money
than anything else.

265
00:10:47,723 --> 00:10:49,473
So unless
you're here to tell me

266
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,082
I'm moving
into Stu's office...

267
00:10:51,707 --> 00:10:53,106
I'd say we're done.

268
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,520
Nick.

269
00:10:56,545 --> 00:10:59,473
My name is Harvey Specter.
Ask around.

270
00:10:59,582 --> 00:11:02,262
You'll find people who go up
against me, they never win.

271
00:11:02,512 --> 00:11:05,200
So I think long and hard
about what you'll do.

272
00:11:20,954 --> 00:11:22,672
Thomas, hi.

273
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,375
Is everything okay?

274
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:28,602
Yeah, uh... It's fine.
It's just a work thing.

275
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,961
Wanna talk about it?

276
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,047
Or tonight,
if now's not a good time.

277
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,305
To tell you the truth,
I just wanna go out,

278
00:11:34,391 --> 00:11:38,018
and spend time with you,
and not think about it at all.

279
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,446
Then I'll see you tonight.

280
00:11:44,186 --> 00:11:46,227
Donna.
You wanted to see me.

281
00:11:46,322 --> 00:11:49,032
Yeah. I was hoping you could point me
in the right direction.

282
00:11:49,118 --> 00:11:50,266
The right direction
of what?

283
00:11:50,352 --> 00:11:53,305
A trader we represent is
accused of manipulating a stock.

284
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:56,039
And in order to understand
how much exposure he has...

285
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,573
You need to know if anyone
was significantly harmed by the trades.

286
00:11:58,658 --> 00:12:00,375
Exactly.
I'll call my guy,

287
00:12:00,477 --> 00:12:01,705
have the answer for you
in no time.

288
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,477
That's the thing, Alex.

289
00:12:03,854 --> 00:12:05,657
It needs to stay
under the radar.

290
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:07,727
I don't understand.

291
00:12:07,813 --> 00:12:09,595
If they're already charged,
what difference does it make...?

292
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,524
I never said
they're already been charged.

293
00:12:11,922 --> 00:12:14,422
Then what exactly
is going on here?

294
00:12:14,507 --> 00:12:15,822
'Caude, if they're not
being charged,

295
00:12:15,907 --> 00:12:19,235
how do you know there was a...?
Please tell me we're not involved in this.

296
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,983
We may have been the
ones who asked

297
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:23,042
the trader to make the
trade in the first place.

298
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:25,211
So we're not just in it.
We orchestrated it.

299
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:28,711
We did. But it was
to save hundreds of jobs.

300
00:12:28,797 --> 00:12:30,480
The guy who caught wind of it
has no idea

301
00:12:30,565 --> 00:12:31,673
that we have anything to do
with it.

302
00:12:31,758 --> 00:12:33,923
Then, I'll find who was on
the other side of those trades.

303
00:12:34,008 --> 00:12:36,802
I'll do it so quietly,
no one will know I was there.

304
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,774
Did you want Brian?

305
00:12:46,187 --> 00:12:47,195
Excuse me?

306
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:48,962
He said you two
have been working very hard.

307
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:51,631
Immediately he was gonna spend
the morning at home.

308
00:12:52,267 --> 00:12:53,743
He should be in
any minute.

309
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,063
Great.

310
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,436
I can have him come see you
as soon as he gets in.

311
00:12:59,522 --> 00:13:02,232
Unless there's something
I can help you with?

312
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:04,672
You know what, Susan?

313
00:13:05,073 --> 00:13:06,321
There is.

314
00:13:10,797 --> 00:13:11,954
Good afternoon.

315
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,333
I'm Samantha Wheeler.
I represent Ms. O'Brien.

316
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,348
Unless...
and you must be ready

317
00:13:16,434 --> 00:13:17,526
to plead guilty,
we don't have much

318
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:19,086
- to talk about.
- Then, I'll get right to it.

319
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:21,783
Ms. O'Brien pleads guilty
to misdemeanor possession

320
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:23,930
with a hefty fine
and six months' probation.

321
00:13:24,016 --> 00:13:25,662
Problem is that,
this isn't a misdemeanor.

322
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:27,174
Those pills were for distribution.

323
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,418
Which is circumstantial
at best.

324
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:30,024
Not based on
how many pills there were.

325
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,728
You know what I'll do with
how many pills there were?

326
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:32,962
I'm gonna question the count.

327
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:34,806
Then I'm gonna to adjust
for what they were cut with.

328
00:13:34,891 --> 00:13:37,714
Then I'm gonna question the legitimacy
of the stop in the first place.

329
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:40,800
When I'm done, you'll be lucky
to get her on a parking ticket.

330
00:13:40,885 --> 00:13:42,189
That might work
where you come from,

331
00:13:42,274 --> 00:13:44,508
but no jury in this town
will believe any of that.

332
00:13:44,594 --> 00:13:47,282
What's wrong with you?
Ms. O'Brien has been an asset

333
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,040
to this community
for 20 years.

334
00:13:49,126 --> 00:13:50,589
With all the respect,
Ms. Wheeler,

335
00:13:50,675 --> 00:13:52,442
you don't know damn thing
about this community.

336
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:55,559
And I don't know what that woman did
to get some Manhattan lawyer from Corner

337
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,961
but it won't stop me
from doing what I have to.

338
00:13:58,047 --> 00:13:59,297
What is that
supposed to mean?

339
00:13:59,383 --> 00:14:01,384
Do you think
I don't know what's going on here?

340
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:03,516
Those pills weren't hers.
They were that kid's.

341
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:05,998
I don't believe this.
You think she's innocent,

342
00:14:06,084 --> 00:14:08,680
and you'll still throw the book
at a 65-year-old woman?

343
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:10,391
I am going to do
whatever it takes

344
00:14:10,477 --> 00:14:12,204
to keep those drugs
out of my county.

345
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:15,297
Look, I am not a monster.
You want to do right by her,

346
00:14:15,383 --> 00:14:18,461
convince her to make that kid
take responsibility for what he did.

347
00:14:22,012 --> 00:14:23,586
I don't understand.

348
00:14:24,469 --> 00:14:25,595
If the deposition
didn't go well,

349
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,563
can't we re-depose them?

350
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:28,540
- No, Susan, we can't.
- Why not?

351
00:14:28,975 --> 00:14:30,696
Among other things,

352
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:32,991
they'll be ready
for our line of questioning.

353
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:35,179
What if...?
Just...

354
00:14:35,563 --> 00:14:37,555
give me a minute to think.

355
00:14:38,237 --> 00:14:41,032
Excuse me, Katrina.
Can I talk to you for a second?

356
00:14:41,644 --> 00:14:43,144
Of course.

357
00:14:43,307 --> 00:14:44,852
Can you give us the room?

358
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,336
- When were you gonna tell me?
- Tell you what?

359
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,329
That you were pulling me
off the Adored case.

360
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,102
I already told you,
we can't work together anymore.

361
00:15:00,188 --> 00:15:02,032
I know,
and I let that go,

362
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:04,469
because you weren't
in the mood to talk about it.

363
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:07,305
But I didn't think
you were gonna pull me off

364
00:15:07,391 --> 00:15:08,682
in the middle of a case.

365
00:15:08,913 --> 00:15:09,961
Well, I wasn't going to,

366
00:15:10,047 --> 00:15:11,673
but then you weren't
at your desk,

367
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:12,800
and I...

368
00:15:13,006 --> 00:15:13,938
You what?

369
00:15:14,024 --> 00:15:16,275
I picked someone else,
okay?

370
00:15:16,718 --> 00:15:18,552
Because like I said,

371
00:15:18,714 --> 00:15:21,094
it's not going to work
between us.

372
00:15:21,606 --> 00:15:24,148
Oh, well, that's fantastic,
Katrina.

373
00:15:24,234 --> 00:15:25,776
But when I'm your associate,

374
00:15:25,862 --> 00:15:28,864
and I find out from someone else
I'm no longer on the case,

375
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,594
it makes me look
like an idiot.

376
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:32,368
I don't think
I should be punished

377
00:15:32,454 --> 00:15:33,993
when this was your fault.

378
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,969
We said
it was nobody's fault.

379
00:15:36,055 --> 00:15:38,139
It sure as hell wasn't mine.

380
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,438
It's not fair that my reputation
in this firm takes a hit

381
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:42,563
when you were the one...

382
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:44,149
I was the one that what?

383
00:15:44,613 --> 00:15:45,946
You know what, Katrina?

384
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:48,165
You don't wanna work together,
then we won't.

385
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:51,430
But I aprreciate,
you think of a reason we can give

386
00:15:51,516 --> 00:15:53,954
that doesn't make me look
like shit.

387
00:16:05,212 --> 00:16:07,313
Harvey Specter.
Kevin Miller.

388
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,191
From a prison cell
to a corner office

389
00:16:09,277 --> 00:16:11,694
- in record time.
- Uh, not just a corner office.

390
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,094
Biggest office
in the firm.

391
00:16:13,194 --> 00:16:14,438
I think
things have been good?

392
00:16:14,524 --> 00:16:17,141
Better than good.
The Sutter cloud is gone,

393
00:16:17,235 --> 00:16:18,383
things are great
with Jill,

394
00:16:18,469 --> 00:16:20,427
and the firm
is growing like crazy.

395
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:22,024
Glad to hear it, because

396
00:16:22,117 --> 00:16:24,133
I need you
to make room for one more.

397
00:16:24,345 --> 00:16:26,304
You're sending someone my way?
Must be a star.

398
00:16:26,427 --> 00:16:29,696
Actually, Kevin, he's a snake,
but you'll take him on anyway.

399
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,281
And why would I
do that?

400
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:34,454
'Cause, someone I care about is being
blackmailed by this bastard.

401
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:35,836
Ah. I get it.

402
00:16:35,922 --> 00:16:37,344
You're asking me
to make him an offer

403
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,102
to get him off your back.

404
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,508
That's right, except...

405
00:16:41,821 --> 00:16:43,071
I'm not asking.

406
00:16:43,157 --> 00:16:46,172
Harvey, come on, heh.
I mean, I've just got my life back.

407
00:16:46,258 --> 00:16:48,514
I can't bring someone else...
that'll send me back to prison.

408
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,545
I know I owe you,
but not like this.

409
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,998
Yes, like this.
Because, I did hell of worse for you.

410
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:54,985
If I hadn't,
you'd be rotting in prison.

411
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:58,204
So when I call in a favor,
you don't put conditions on it.

412
00:16:58,368 --> 00:17:01,022
All right. Just tell me his name.
I'll write up an offer,

413
00:17:01,108 --> 00:17:02,462
and make it look like
a headhunter found him.

414
00:17:02,547 --> 00:17:04,079
His name is Nick Pavonotti.

415
00:17:04,165 --> 00:17:05,899
And you can skip
the headhunter part.

416
00:17:05,985 --> 00:17:08,500
He'll know it's from me.
You make him an offer.

417
00:17:08,663 --> 00:17:11,368
And you tell him it's not worth it
to mess with Harvey Specter.

418
00:17:13,547 --> 00:17:15,891
Never thought
I'd see this place again.

419
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,733
I have to say, it doesn't look
too much worse for wear.

420
00:17:20,162 --> 00:17:21,756
How did it go
with the prosecutor?

421
00:17:21,842 --> 00:17:23,053
Were you able
to make a deal?

422
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:25,045
It's not gonna be
that easy, Judy.

423
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,553
She knows the drugs
are Corey's, not yours.

424
00:17:27,772 --> 00:17:30,204
Then she should be willing
to go easy on me.

425
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,795
No, she shouldn't.
And she isn't.

426
00:17:33,065 --> 00:17:35,942
Because she won't let you
stop her from doing her job.

427
00:17:36,028 --> 00:17:37,170
Well, I have a job too,

428
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,006
and that's to protect
my children.

429
00:17:39,186 --> 00:17:42,045
I won't let them ruin his life
because of one mistake.

430
00:17:42,131 --> 00:17:43,405
It won't ruin his life.

431
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:44,944
They'll take him away
from me.

432
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,662
If you don't do this,

433
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:49,166
they're gonna take them
all from you.

434
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,272
I can't do it.

435
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:52,725
I can't sacrifice him
for everyone else.

436
00:17:52,813 --> 00:17:54,530
- Why not?
- Because I already did that

437
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:55,717
with you.

438
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:56,912
No.

439
00:17:57,087 --> 00:17:58,694
You didn't have a choice
with me.

440
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,131
They took me from you.

441
00:18:00,217 --> 00:18:01,780
And before they did...

442
00:18:02,253 --> 00:18:04,717
they asked if I wanted
to keep trying.

443
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,951
And I said, no.

444
00:18:07,037 --> 00:18:08,319
I don't believe this.

445
00:18:08,762 --> 00:18:10,740
You've been lying to me,
all these years?

446
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,874
I didn't want to hurt you.
If you didn't wanna hurt me,

447
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,787
you should've kept me.

448
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,733
Or at least
told me the truth about it.

449
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:19,983
I couldn't do that.
I couldn't tell you

450
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:22,320
I was choosing the good
of everyone over you.

451
00:18:22,365 --> 00:18:25,157
- What would it have done to you?
- What do you think it did?

452
00:18:25,243 --> 00:18:26,402
- Samantha.
- No.

453
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:27,912
Let me just get this
straight.

454
00:18:27,998 --> 00:18:31,733
Rather than fight for me,
or even tell me the truth,

455
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,256
you gave up on me.

456
00:18:33,342 --> 00:18:35,701
And then years later,
walk into my home,

457
00:18:35,787 --> 00:18:38,701
to have me save you from making
the same mistake again?

458
00:18:38,787 --> 00:18:40,764
You were the only person
I knew who could help.

459
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,998
I could have, Judy,
but not anymore.

460
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:44,436
Samantha, please.

461
00:18:44,522 --> 00:18:45,897
I used that word
with you.

462
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:48,459
I said, "Please,
don't let them take me."

463
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,819
But you could've stopped them,
and you didn't.

464
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,951
So now I'm giving up on you.

465
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,326
Katrina, whatever it is,
I'm on my way out, so...

466
00:19:04,451 --> 00:19:05,892
- That's what...
- Then, this won't take long.

467
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:07,513
I would just like
to start the process

468
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:10,201
of having Brian removed
as my associate.

469
00:19:10,328 --> 00:19:12,896
What?
He's too advanced for me.

470
00:19:13,146 --> 00:19:14,388
All right.

471
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,185
You wanna tell me what
happened between the two of you?

472
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,864
Or should I figure it out
myself?

473
00:19:19,949 --> 00:19:22,060
- Nothing happened.
- Won't take long to figure out.

474
00:19:22,146 --> 00:19:25,440
I'm pretty sure you would rather
just tell me about it yourself.

475
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,372
Okay, look.

476
00:19:27,468 --> 00:19:29,974
You told me
not to go into the kitchen.

477
00:19:30,246 --> 00:19:31,755
And I tried not to.

478
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:35,837
But it turns out,
everywhere we go is the kitchen.

479
00:19:35,923 --> 00:19:37,669
So did something happen,
or not?

480
00:19:37,755 --> 00:19:40,310
No. But we both wanted it to.

481
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:42,563
Then I told him
I can't work with him anymore.

482
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:45,192
Then we can't to have fight, because
he said it would hurt him

483
00:19:45,278 --> 00:19:47,264
if I can't explain
why he's not my associate anymore.

484
00:19:47,349 --> 00:19:49,091
And that's why
I told you that bullshit

485
00:19:49,177 --> 00:19:51,279
about him being too advanced.

486
00:19:51,396 --> 00:19:53,294
Bet it feels good
to get that off your chest.

487
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,708
Only so much because
I still don't know what to do.

488
00:19:56,794 --> 00:19:57,901
Talk to him about it.

489
00:19:57,987 --> 00:19:59,654
- I told you, I tried.
- No.

490
00:19:59,739 --> 00:20:02,060
You told me you fought with him.
Fighting isn't talking.

491
00:20:02,146 --> 00:20:04,814
- I know that better than anyone.
- What do you mean?

492
00:20:04,968 --> 00:20:06,794
I mean I understand
what it's like

493
00:20:06,897 --> 00:20:09,982
to have complicated issues
with someone you work with,

494
00:20:10,068 --> 00:20:12,268
especially when a person can't
have a real conversation.

495
00:20:12,585 --> 00:20:15,224
- What you're talking about...?
- You know who I'm talking about.

496
00:20:15,432 --> 00:20:17,997
Knowing that doesn't tell me
what I should do.

497
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:19,099
I told you.

498
00:20:19,245 --> 00:20:21,005
Talk about it again.

499
00:20:21,526 --> 00:20:23,677
If you can't,
we'll have a real problem.

500
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:25,013
Because Brian's right.

501
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:26,931
You could really hurt
his career.

502
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:28,576
Now I'm gonna go.

503
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,893
Because sometimes the answer
is to fall for someone

504
00:20:31,979 --> 00:20:34,576
who has nothing to do
with this place at all.

505
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:44,310
Robert, plase tell me you haven't gone
to Louis' client meeting yet.

506
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,533
I was just on my way.
Why?

507
00:20:45,618 --> 00:20:47,005
Because I can take it
from here.

508
00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:49,203
You can't be at two places
at once.

509
00:20:49,288 --> 00:20:51,396
Doesn't matter.
I dropped Judy's case.

510
00:20:51,497 --> 00:20:53,802
What? Samantha,
why would you do that?

511
00:20:53,888 --> 00:20:56,598
Same reason any attorney would.
Because, my client lied to me.

512
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,595
So thank you
for covering for me,

513
00:20:58,681 --> 00:20:59,930
but I've got it from here.

514
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:01,099
You're not taking anything

515
00:21:01,185 --> 00:21:02,979
until you tell me
what's going on.

516
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:06,222
I've got all night,
Samantha.

517
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:12,146
I always thought
it was the state

518
00:21:12,294 --> 00:21:13,935
that took me from her.

519
00:21:14,097 --> 00:21:15,638
Turns out it was Judy.

520
00:21:15,981 --> 00:21:17,412
She put me back
in the system,

521
00:21:17,498 --> 00:21:19,802
just when I thought
I had a real home.

522
00:21:20,037 --> 00:21:21,888
So tell me,
why should I stick by her

523
00:21:21,974 --> 00:21:23,990
when she didn't
stick by me?

524
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:25,404
I don't know,
Samantha.

525
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:28,263
But for her to admit all of that
must have killed her.

526
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:30,279
Didn't do wonders
for me either, Robert.

527
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,983
What You're saying
I should throw her a party?

528
00:21:32,068 --> 00:21:33,577
I'm saying that
sometimes being a parent

529
00:21:33,662 --> 00:21:35,552
is living with choices
that break your heart.

530
00:21:35,638 --> 00:21:37,639
It's not often
you get to make up for them.

531
00:21:37,738 --> 00:21:39,947
You have a chance
to help this woman do that.

532
00:21:40,087 --> 00:21:41,779
I think
maybe you should take it.

533
00:21:42,105 --> 00:21:44,607
Even if I was willing to,
I still can't get her a deal.

534
00:21:44,693 --> 00:21:47,458
Let's put our heads together
and figure something out.

535
00:21:47,544 --> 00:21:49,576
What about Louis' meeting?
He'll understand.

536
00:21:49,662 --> 00:21:53,169
If he doesn't,
you tell him to come see me.

537
00:21:59,734 --> 00:22:01,927
Pretty nice office
for a fake consultant.

538
00:22:02,013 --> 00:22:03,388
What are you doing here?

539
00:22:03,508 --> 00:22:05,372
I made to tell you that
You're negotiating

540
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,677
from a position of weakness.

541
00:22:06,763 --> 00:22:08,240
Because first
you try to stop me,

542
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:11,326
and then Kevin Miller
offers me a job, out of nowhere,

543
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,474
telling me it's not worth it
to go against you.

544
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,559
It isn't.

545
00:22:14,645 --> 00:22:15,849
Yeah,
you keep saying that.

546
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:17,497
But I did some digging.

547
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,814
On the very same day

548
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,442
the Doyle Shoes trades
were made,

549
00:22:20,564 --> 00:22:22,607
a woman,
who is now your COO,

550
00:22:22,802 --> 00:22:25,052
signed into our visitors' log
to meet with Stu.

551
00:22:25,176 --> 00:22:27,357
"Donna Paulsen"
I think is her name, right?

552
00:22:27,463 --> 00:22:29,171
Be very careful
what you say next,

553
00:22:29,257 --> 00:22:30,215
and who you threaten.

554
00:22:30,338 --> 00:22:31,662
Looks like
I touched a nerve.

555
00:22:31,748 --> 00:22:33,790
Nick, you have no idea
who you're dealing with.

556
00:22:33,924 --> 00:22:36,224
What I know stock manipulation
is a crime.

557
00:22:36,312 --> 00:22:38,490
So is blackmail.
And we can avoid prosecution

558
00:22:38,576 --> 00:22:40,868
for either of those
if you stop coming at me,

559
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,701
and start working on
Stu Buzzini's retirement party.

560
00:22:43,816 --> 00:22:45,649
But you better do it soon,

561
00:22:45,954 --> 00:22:47,794
because I'm not gonna wait
much longer.

562
00:22:47,938 --> 00:22:50,966
If you're trying to play a game
of chicken with me,

563
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:52,591
you'll never win.

564
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,740
But I'm not just playing
with you.

565
00:22:55,143 --> 00:22:59,326
I'm playing with you,
Stu Buzzini, and Donna Paulsen.

566
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:03,318
Really is a nice office.

567
00:23:10,871 --> 00:23:12,262
What the hell is your problem?

568
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:14,552
It's bad enough Samantha
farms out her responsibilities,

569
00:23:14,638 --> 00:23:16,772
without telling me.
Then you blow them off?

570
00:23:16,858 --> 00:23:18,380
- You just calm down.
- Calm down?

571
00:23:18,466 --> 00:23:19,779
I take one night off

572
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:22,449
to prepare my home
for my unborn child's arrival.

573
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:24,326
I'm supposed to enjoy it,
but I can't,

574
00:23:24,412 --> 00:23:26,413
because you and Samantha
don't give a shit.

575
00:23:26,552 --> 00:23:28,935
You finished?
No. When you stepped down,

576
00:23:29,052 --> 00:23:30,841
it's like you said,
"I can do what I want."

577
00:23:30,927 --> 00:23:33,345
Apparently what you want
is to let this firm down,

578
00:23:33,431 --> 00:23:36,154
let our clients down,
and most of all, let me down.

579
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,943
That's enough! I won't listen
to another word at your loose end.

580
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:40,333
From the minute
I stepped down,

581
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:42,000
- all I've done is help you.
- Help me?

582
00:23:42,085 --> 00:23:43,795
First with Harvey
on the Malik case.

583
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,286
Then again with Harvey
on your poker bullshit.

584
00:23:46,372 --> 00:23:48,208
Now with a partner
who's going through

585
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:50,435
something more important
than a client dinner.

586
00:23:50,521 --> 00:23:52,334
Are you saying Samantha's
going through something?

587
00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:54,896
Yes, Louis, I am.

588
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,794
I'm sorry, Robert. I...

589
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,916
It is just so much.

590
00:24:02,314 --> 00:24:04,106
The pressure, it's just...

591
00:24:05,122 --> 00:24:08,333
- It's too much.
- I know, Louis.

592
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:10,889
And I wish I could tell you
it gets easier. But I can't.

593
00:24:10,974 --> 00:24:12,607
But I can tell you
do your best

594
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:14,107
not to take it out
on people around you.

595
00:24:14,192 --> 00:24:15,232
You're right.

596
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:17,473
Thank you.

597
00:24:18,027 --> 00:24:19,403
I'm sorry I blew up at you.

598
00:24:19,497 --> 00:24:20,637
No need to apologize.

599
00:24:20,868 --> 00:24:22,825
Asking you
what is going on with Samantha?

600
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:26,193
Louis, if you think your people
have something going on...

601
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:28,482
you should probably ask them
yourself.

602
00:24:31,826 --> 00:24:32,912
Donna, good.

603
00:24:32,998 --> 00:24:34,740
Let's grab a coffee.

604
00:24:35,604 --> 00:24:36,769
Sure.

605
00:24:36,855 --> 00:24:38,654
I could use some caffeine.

606
00:24:40,507 --> 00:24:42,662
And since we both know
"let's grab coffee"

607
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,357
is code for
"shit's gone sideways,"

608
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:46,083
Harvey, just tell me
what's going on.

609
00:24:46,201 --> 00:24:48,202
Nick Pavonotti put
the pieces together.

610
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:50,152
He knows we were involved
in that trade.

611
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:52,112
So the firm's
in his crosshairs now too.

612
00:24:52,197 --> 00:24:53,318
Not just the firm.

613
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:56,656
He also knows that you came
to see Stu that day.

614
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,021
I'm sorry, Donna.
I never should've let you...

615
00:24:59,107 --> 00:25:02,646
Harvey, don't even bother going down
that road. I made my decision.

616
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,271
We have to decide
how to fix this.

617
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:07,716
- We may not be able to fix it.
- Don't tell me.

618
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:09,295
Someone got burned
by that trade.

619
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:11,049
Not just burned.
Scorched.

620
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,968
A Police pension fund sold at
the wrong time, took a huge hit.

621
00:25:14,053 --> 00:25:16,561
This thing comes out, you're not able
to say, "No harm, no foul."

622
00:25:16,646 --> 00:25:17,771
Son of a bitch.

623
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:19,388
Harvey, if you're out of time,

624
00:25:19,474 --> 00:25:21,591
- I don't see any other way.
- Any other than what?

625
00:25:21,677 --> 00:25:22,958
Giving in
to what this guy wants.

626
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:25,029
No. Harvey, we can't ask Stu
to step down.

627
00:25:25,115 --> 00:25:26,997
Stu knew the risks
when he made that trade.

628
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,780
And you can tell yourself that
to feel better,

629
00:25:28,865 --> 00:25:31,365
but I'm the one
who convinced him to do it.

630
00:25:32,195 --> 00:25:34,865
I only did it because you said
it's just a civil violation.

631
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:36,669
Now it sounds like
he could go to prison.

632
00:25:36,755 --> 00:25:38,919
Nothing is gonna happen
if he does this.

633
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:40,044
He won't do it.

634
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,161
- You'll have to make him do it.
- Me?

635
00:25:42,247 --> 00:25:43,871
Yeah, you.
You said it yourself.

636
00:25:43,957 --> 00:25:45,717
You're the only one
who could've convinced him

637
00:25:45,802 --> 00:25:46,944
to do this in the first place.

638
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:49,252
Because he trusts me.
I won't take advantage of that

639
00:25:49,338 --> 00:25:52,154
until you tell me that
there's nothing else we can do.

640
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,513
Because there is,
and you know it.

641
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:55,747
What is she talking about?

642
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,955
She's talking about going
to Sean Cahill

643
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:59,332
to make him bury this thing.

644
00:25:59,418 --> 00:26:01,186
He's going to wanna help us
even less than Stu.

645
00:26:01,271 --> 00:26:05,044
If you want me to make Stu
take the hit for all of us...

646
00:26:05,383 --> 00:26:08,013
the least you can do
is give it a shot with Cahill.

647
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:25,849
Samantha. I was afraid
I'd never see you again.

648
00:26:25,935 --> 00:26:27,310
You almost didn't.

649
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,786
Before you say another word,
I need you to look at me.

650
00:26:31,617 --> 00:26:33,158
Take a good long look.

651
00:26:33,306 --> 00:26:34,779
I don't understand.

652
00:26:35,266 --> 00:26:37,016
I turned out just fine.

653
00:26:37,661 --> 00:26:38,997
So as far
as I'm concerned,

654
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:40,444
the problem wasn't
that you cut me loose,

655
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:41,888
it's that you lied to me.

656
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:44,404
So if you want my help,

657
00:26:44,622 --> 00:26:46,122
you're gonna tell Corey
the truth.

658
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:48,224
He's gonna take
responsibility for his actions.

659
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,685
And then we're gonna get him
the best deal possible.

660
00:26:50,771 --> 00:26:52,949
- And it won't ruin his life.
- How do you know that?

661
00:26:53,034 --> 00:26:55,825
Because I know what I'm
gonna say to that prosecutor.

662
00:26:59,036 --> 00:27:00,123
Sean.

663
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:02,310
What a surprise
running into you here.

664
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:04,966
You hungry? Why don't we grab
a big, fat steak.

665
00:27:05,052 --> 00:27:06,317
Nah, I'd rather go vegan,

666
00:27:06,403 --> 00:27:07,964
- because I know that look.
- What look?

667
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:10,925
The look, it says either "My nana died,"
or you need a favor.

668
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,552
All right, I do.

669
00:27:12,685 --> 00:27:14,372
A client of ours
may or may not

670
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,661
have manipulated a stock
at our behest.

671
00:27:16,747 --> 00:27:18,161
We're being blackmailed
for it,

672
00:27:18,247 --> 00:27:19,767
and I need you to bury
the whole thing.

673
00:27:19,866 --> 00:27:22,309
- Are you out of your mind?
- I know it sounds bad.

674
00:27:22,395 --> 00:27:23,646
No, no, no. It sounds illegal.

675
00:27:23,732 --> 00:27:25,279
You're lucky
I'm not arresting you right now.

676
00:27:25,364 --> 00:27:26,770
Listen to me.
We onlyorchestrated

677
00:27:26,856 --> 00:27:28,630
this trade so hundreds
of innocent people

678
00:27:28,716 --> 00:27:29,739
could keep their jobs.

679
00:27:29,825 --> 00:27:31,172
I don't care why you did it.

680
00:27:31,258 --> 00:27:33,481
I'm not helping you.
I don't believe this.

681
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:35,294
I helped you
put away the man

682
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,224
that cost your mother
everything.

683
00:27:38,622 --> 00:27:40,247
How's Mike doing, Harvey?

684
00:27:40,498 --> 00:27:43,833
Because if memory serves,
I helped save his life.

685
00:27:43,918 --> 00:27:46,341
You did, and
I will always be grateful.

686
00:27:46,504 --> 00:27:48,770
Your idea of gratitude
is sticking to handout for more?

687
00:27:48,856 --> 00:27:50,459
I wouldn't be here,
if there was any other way.

688
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,551
I moved heaven and earth
for you once before,

689
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:53,966
and now the well is dry.

690
00:27:54,052 --> 00:27:55,575
...dig little deeper. Because,

691
00:27:55,661 --> 00:27:57,644
if people found out
about that heaven and earth,

692
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,057
they wouldn't throw you
a parade.

693
00:27:59,142 --> 00:28:00,786
You just admitted to
stock manipulation.

694
00:28:00,872 --> 00:28:02,286
Instead of threatening me,

695
00:28:02,372 --> 00:28:04,419
you should thank me
for not slapping cuffs on you.

696
00:28:04,505 --> 00:28:06,380
I warn you,
go back to your office and pray

697
00:28:06,466 --> 00:28:07,966
that blackmailer
doesn't come to me,

698
00:28:08,052 --> 00:28:11,052
'cause if he does,
I'm not gonna bury this thing.

699
00:28:11,424 --> 00:28:13,175
I'm gonna bury you.

700
00:28:18,512 --> 00:28:19,944
All right, Donna, I'm here.

701
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:22,997
Last time I took meeting with you,
you had me to do something I regret.

702
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:24,198
I hope you're not
here to try to get me

703
00:28:24,283 --> 00:28:25,318
do somrthing
like that again.

704
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,403
I'm here to say that that trade
screwed over a pension fund

705
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:30,380
to the tune of $20 million.

706
00:28:30,729 --> 00:28:32,411
I get it. Yes, I mean,
if I don't give

707
00:28:32,497 --> 00:28:33,943
that piece of shit my job,
I'll lose my license.

708
00:28:34,028 --> 00:28:35,645
I'm telling you
it could get a lot worse.

709
00:28:35,731 --> 00:28:37,427
- And I'm sorry...
- I don't want an apology.

710
00:28:37,512 --> 00:28:39,192
- I want a way out.
- This is a way out.

711
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:41,020
- It's for you and Harvey, not me.
- Stu.

712
00:28:41,106 --> 00:28:44,395
Ah, damn. This whole thing was his idea.
Now, instead of getting me out,

713
00:28:44,481 --> 00:28:46,605
- he wants me to take the bullet?
- It's the only way...

714
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:49,023
Is it? It took me 20 years
to get where I am.

715
00:28:49,108 --> 00:28:50,858
I'm not gonna to surrender
to some blackmailer

716
00:28:50,927 --> 00:28:53,161
unless my only option is
that or prison.

717
00:28:53,325 --> 00:28:54,950
What if that is the choice?

718
00:28:55,036 --> 00:28:56,489
Then I'll step down.

719
00:28:57,371 --> 00:29:00,184
But I'll always remember, it was
my friends that made me do it.

720
00:29:00,575 --> 00:29:02,248
Allow me to ask this one,
what makes you think he won't

721
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,692
keep using this against us?

722
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:06,387
Harvey will make Nick sign
something implicating himself

723
00:29:06,473 --> 00:29:07,473
if he brings it up again.

724
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,661
It'll be mutually assured
destruction.

725
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:12,288
Then if you'll excuse me,
I gotta get back.

726
00:29:12,512 --> 00:29:14,927
Got lot of work to do,
while the firm is still mine.

727
00:29:22,497 --> 00:29:24,481
I hope you're here
to sign my plea offer.

728
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:26,505
Because, I don't have time
for more negotiations.

729
00:29:26,591 --> 00:29:28,200
I'm not signing
anything.

730
00:29:28,504 --> 00:29:29,677
I'm sorry?

731
00:29:29,816 --> 00:29:30,951
She's not signing on anything.

732
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:32,669
Because, we both know
she didn't do it.

733
00:29:32,778 --> 00:29:34,569
So you're saying
I'm free to go after the kid.

734
00:29:34,654 --> 00:29:36,208
You are. When you do,

735
00:29:36,294 --> 00:29:38,778
I'll be representing him, and
I'll be giving the jury this.

736
00:29:38,962 --> 00:29:42,481
And this is a rap sheet
from 20 years ago.

737
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:45,067
That's right.
Possession, theft, vandalism.

738
00:29:45,153 --> 00:29:47,020
- And the name's been redacted.
- So what?

739
00:29:47,106 --> 00:29:48,911
You said I didn't
know about this community.

740
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:50,084
Well, you're wrong.

741
00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:52,489
I grew up here.
Those crimes?

742
00:29:52,575 --> 00:29:54,442
I committed them here.
That's my rap sheet.

743
00:29:54,528 --> 00:29:57,005
Nice story, but it has nothing
to do with this case.

744
00:29:57,091 --> 00:29:59,559
Yes, it does. Because,
you wanted to know what Judy did

745
00:29:59,645 --> 00:30:01,638
to get a lawyer like me
in her corner.

746
00:30:01,794 --> 00:30:03,177
She raised me.

747
00:30:03,349 --> 00:30:05,325
And if you take Corey away
from her,

748
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:06,880
he won't have the chance
to turn

749
00:30:06,966 --> 00:30:09,098
into the productive member
of society

750
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,497
that she can help him
become.

751
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:15,137
So he's gonna plead down
to misdemeanor possession,

752
00:30:15,223 --> 00:30:16,194
community service,

753
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,161
and it will not go
on his record.

754
00:30:18,247 --> 00:30:20,294
And if I say no?
I'll take my story,

755
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,036
my rap sheet,
and that 16-year-old...

756
00:30:22,122 --> 00:30:24,076
And you tell it again
in open court.

757
00:30:24,247 --> 00:30:26,927
I can break a jury in
a number of ways. That's one.

758
00:30:27,348 --> 00:30:28,497
You raised this?

759
00:30:28,614 --> 00:30:30,622
I did.
And I'm proud of her.

760
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:33,091
Well, I suppose
that's punishment enough.

761
00:30:37,437 --> 00:30:38,897
You have yourselves
a deal.

762
00:30:40,301 --> 00:30:43,286
I'll have my office draw up
the paperwork.

763
00:30:45,391 --> 00:30:47,114
Samantha, thank you.

764
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,317
I couldn't have done this
without you.

765
00:30:51,773 --> 00:30:54,067
I could say the same thing
to you, Judy.

766
00:30:57,153 --> 00:30:59,445
If you're in here,
I take it Cahill said no.

767
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,739
He didn't just say no.

768
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:03,567
He said I was lucky
he wasn't arresting me.

769
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,286
Which means Stu's our only hope.
Not necessarily.

770
00:31:07,372 --> 00:31:09,833
- Please tell me you got him to agree.
- I did.

771
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:13,466
It was hard, and it hurt,
but I did.

772
00:31:13,762 --> 00:31:15,591
Then he asked how we're sure

773
00:31:15,677 --> 00:31:17,825
Nick won't keep holding this
over our heads.

774
00:31:17,911 --> 00:31:19,434
Easy. We'll make him sign
an agreement,

775
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,364
- which I can draft now.
- If I'm right,

776
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,732
Nick won't have to sign anything,
Stu won't have to step down.

777
00:31:23,817 --> 00:31:26,411
If Stu doesn't step down,
Nick goes to the SEC.

778
00:31:26,505 --> 00:31:28,708
In case you weren't paying attention,
Cahill said no.

779
00:31:28,794 --> 00:31:31,114
Maybe that because
you didn't him ask the right question.

780
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,459
What the hell
you're talking about?

781
00:31:32,544 --> 00:31:35,239
I'm trying to tell you,
I have an idea.

782
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:39,091
Looking over
your future kingdom?

783
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,781
Sorry to disappoint you,
but you won't get the crown.

784
00:31:42,997 --> 00:31:44,278
And who the hell are you?

785
00:31:44,364 --> 00:31:45,856
You heard from the B team.

786
00:31:45,942 --> 00:31:48,202
Well, I'm the A team.

787
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:50,121
The guy you know nothing
about.

788
00:31:50,255 --> 00:31:53,499
Not my name, or where
I'm from, or what I do.

789
00:31:53,584 --> 00:31:55,239
Well, I know who sent you.

790
00:31:55,325 --> 00:31:58,223
- Harvey Specter isn't gonna...
- Harvey Specter didn't send me, Nick.

791
00:31:58,672 --> 00:31:59,926
Neither did Stu Buzzini.

792
00:32:00,012 --> 00:32:02,833
- Oh, that just leaves Teddy Doyle.
- Whom I've never met in my life.

793
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:04,928
And yet here I am,
calling your bluff.

794
00:32:05,013 --> 00:32:06,304
And what bluff is that?

795
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:08,356
The one where you think
anyone is gonna to believe

796
00:32:08,442 --> 00:32:10,348
you're gonna to march
into Sean Cahill's office

797
00:32:10,434 --> 00:32:11,893
and tell him
your fairy tale.

798
00:32:12,122 --> 00:32:13,801
Because blackmail
is a crime,

799
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,396
and you don't have
the balls for it.

800
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,887
I see what this is.

801
00:32:17,294 --> 00:32:18,692
I'm not blackmailing anyone,

802
00:32:18,778 --> 00:32:21,348
and you can record me
all you want.

803
00:32:21,622 --> 00:32:23,038
Because it occurs to me

804
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,302
that I don't need Stu
to step down at all.

805
00:32:25,491 --> 00:32:27,551
I just have to do
what you say I won't,

806
00:32:27,637 --> 00:32:29,494
and I'll have a clear path
to the throne.

807
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,739
Nick.
No, no, no.

808
00:32:31,911 --> 00:32:34,598
You don't call my bluff.
I call yours.

809
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:37,669
So tell Harvey, or Stu,
or whoever the fuck sent you,

810
00:32:37,754 --> 00:32:38,919
it didn't work.

811
00:32:39,338 --> 00:32:40,981
And get out of my firm.

812
00:32:41,317 --> 00:32:43,262
'Cause make no mistake,
come tomorrow,

813
00:32:43,348 --> 00:32:44,968
this place is mine.

814
00:32:53,783 --> 00:32:55,285
Working late?

815
00:32:56,942 --> 00:33:00,122
I have to look for another way
to get noticed around here,

816
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:02,084
now that you have to
cut me loose.

817
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:04,669
Look, Brian,
I'm sure you're busy,

818
00:33:04,755 --> 00:33:09,258
- but I think we should talk.
- About what?

819
00:33:09,374 --> 00:33:11,731
About the fact that
you're an outstanding attorney.

820
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,211
And you don't deserve
to be hurt

821
00:33:14,297 --> 00:33:17,661
by a personal matter
that I should've kept in check.

822
00:33:18,469 --> 00:33:20,716
- Katrina, you don't...
- No, it's my fault.

823
00:33:20,802 --> 00:33:22,927
You said it,
and you were right.

824
00:33:24,028 --> 00:33:26,489
I've been feeling...

825
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:28,950
pulled to you,

826
00:33:29,036 --> 00:33:30,411
for quite some time.

827
00:33:30,497 --> 00:33:33,450
I pretended it wasn't true,
and that I could control it.

828
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:35,778
Well, I couldn't.

829
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,934
But I'm not going to let it
hurt your career.

830
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,126
That's not fair.

831
00:33:40,212 --> 00:33:41,461
I lashed out,

832
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:45,137
because I was feeling guilty
about...

833
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:47,231
You know.

834
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,313
And I'm afraid for my career.

835
00:33:51,692 --> 00:33:54,231
And it feels like
I can't make the right decision.

836
00:33:54,317 --> 00:33:58,606
And the wrong one is gonna
bring everything crashing down.

837
00:33:58,692 --> 00:34:00,723
I'm feeling
exactly the same way.

838
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:03,565
So... what are we gonna do?

839
00:34:03,651 --> 00:34:04,692
Well, I have an idea.

840
00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:06,610
I'm not completely sure
about it.

841
00:34:06,696 --> 00:34:11,559
But the one thing I do know is
that no one is going to believe

842
00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:13,285
I traded you
for Susan Carter

843
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,348
- because she's a better lawyer.
- That bad?

844
00:34:15,509 --> 00:34:16,716
Worse.

845
00:34:17,068 --> 00:34:18,652
So, what's your plan?

846
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,184
If we work together for a year,
and it's successful,

847
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,653
which I know it can be...

848
00:34:24,794 --> 00:34:26,708
you'll be on
the junior partner track.

849
00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:28,309
You can have
your own cases.

850
00:34:28,395 --> 00:34:30,717
And I can say
that you're ready

851
00:34:30,803 --> 00:34:32,846
to be more than
just someone's associate.

852
00:34:33,098 --> 00:34:34,794
That sounds like a plan.

853
00:34:34,974 --> 00:34:36,395
Good.

854
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:41,005
Am I allowed to say
you're not just someone?

855
00:34:45,346 --> 00:34:47,305
You probably
shouldn't.

856
00:34:47,593 --> 00:34:49,442
Thank you, Katrina.

857
00:34:49,785 --> 00:34:51,114
Thank you, Brian.

858
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,442
<i>♪ A line in the sand ♪
♪ To show them what you see ♪</i>

859
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:58,544
<i>♪ A line in the sand ♪</i>

860
00:35:00,254 --> 00:35:02,333
As you see, it's clear
stock manipulation,

861
00:35:02,419 --> 00:35:04,127
involving my boss
and his law firm,

862
00:35:04,212 --> 00:35:05,958
all orchestrated
to service a takeover.

863
00:35:06,044 --> 00:35:08,587
- It does appear that way.
- Oh, where is that way.

864
00:35:09,044 --> 00:35:10,675
And I'm not gonna let
Stuart Buzzini

865
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,723
put a black mark
on my firm.

866
00:35:12,898 --> 00:35:15,997
And you chose to do this after hours,
because if you want a career,

867
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:18,003
you surely don't wanna do this
in broad daylight.

868
00:35:18,145 --> 00:35:20,661
The thought did occur to me.
So, what now?

869
00:35:20,747 --> 00:35:22,263
You're gonna
take these guys down, right?

870
00:35:22,348 --> 00:35:23,931
Well, now, that all depends.

871
00:35:24,107 --> 00:35:26,958
Because as much as I hate
crooked traders,

872
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:29,129
I hate blackmailers
even more.

873
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:30,370
What?

874
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:32,151
- I'm here because...
- You're here because

875
00:35:32,237 --> 00:35:33,745
I wanted you here.

876
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,862
And, before you say you don't know
anything about blackmail,

877
00:35:36,955 --> 00:35:39,406
you do. But so does Sean,
because I told him.

878
00:35:39,573 --> 00:35:40,698
That's bullshit.

879
00:35:40,784 --> 00:35:42,325
Shh. Save your breath.

880
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:44,463
You're gonna need to do
some thinking.

881
00:35:44,565 --> 00:35:46,136
Because, I'm gonna tol tell you
the exact same thing.

882
00:35:46,221 --> 00:35:47,831
That I told Harvey
when he came to me.

883
00:35:47,917 --> 00:35:50,182
You're lucky I don't arrest you
right now.

884
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:52,362
- Bullshit you said that.
- He did.

885
00:35:52,487 --> 00:35:55,237
Whether you believe him
or not... I do.

886
00:35:55,323 --> 00:35:57,198
I'm a whistleblower.
I have protections.

887
00:35:57,284 --> 00:35:59,604
Not for blackmailing charges,
you don't.

888
00:35:59,768 --> 00:36:02,175
As far as I'm concerned,
I think, you're both telling the truth.

889
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,753
Which means,
you should both be indicted.

890
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:05,104
But since I have discretion,

891
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,432
I can go after both,
or neither.

892
00:36:07,518 --> 00:36:09,596
I'm sure as shit
not just going after Harvey.

893
00:36:09,682 --> 00:36:11,516
My question I've for you,
Mr. Whistleblower,

894
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:14,760
is do you want
to be prosecuted today, or not?

895
00:36:16,451 --> 00:36:18,549
I'm sorry
to have wasted your time.

896
00:36:20,455 --> 00:36:21,924
Nick,
one more thing.

897
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,844
Stu asked me to let you know
that you're fired.

898
00:36:25,229 --> 00:36:28,049
- On what grounds?
- You remember all those trades

899
00:36:28,135 --> 00:36:29,409
I consulted you on?

900
00:36:29,565 --> 00:36:32,048
They were real,
and they sucked.

901
00:36:32,284 --> 00:36:34,384
But Stu's a generous man.

902
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:36,970
He gave you a healthy
severance package.

903
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,349
Don't spend it all
in one place.

904
00:36:40,808 --> 00:36:42,393
Like it or not, Sean,

905
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:44,370
we still make
a pretty good team.

906
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:48,377
Good team or not,
if he'd gone the other way,

907
00:36:48,463 --> 00:36:50,237
you'd be wearing handcuffs
right now.

908
00:36:50,745 --> 00:36:51,784
For what
it's worth,

909
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,778
we'll make
an anonymous donation

910
00:36:53,863 --> 00:36:55,166
to a certain pension fund.

911
00:36:55,252 --> 00:36:56,572
We'll make them whole,
Sean.

912
00:36:56,657 --> 00:36:57,877
Good for you, Harvey.

913
00:36:57,987 --> 00:36:59,573
But I don't wanna know
about it.

914
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:01,890
Because this is where
the gravy train ends.

915
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,711
And if you ever threaten me
again,

916
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:07,034
I'll take you down
on the spot.

917
00:37:09,087 --> 00:37:10,440
Sean.

918
00:37:11,998 --> 00:37:13,416
Harvey.

919
00:37:16,807 --> 00:37:18,640
Louis,
what are you...?

920
00:37:18,726 --> 00:37:21,245
I wanna
ask you something,

921
00:37:21,331 --> 00:37:23,440
and you don't have to
answer, but...

922
00:37:23,526 --> 00:37:25,409
If this is about
the Chelsea Connor case...

923
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:27,454
- I've..,
- It's not about the case.

924
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,760
Did something happen
between you and Brian?

925
00:37:31,111 --> 00:37:32,144
What?

926
00:37:32,277 --> 00:37:34,194
When I brought your new business cards,
you rememmber.

927
00:37:34,279 --> 00:37:37,424
You were upset. You said you
didn't have love in your life.

928
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,927
And then yesterday,

929
00:37:39,221 --> 00:37:41,471
I bring his name up,
and you get weird.

930
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:44,291
I just want you to know
I care about you.

931
00:37:44,377 --> 00:37:45,413
If something happened...

932
00:37:45,498 --> 00:37:47,112
Yes and no, Louis.

933
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:49,792
- Yes and no.
- What does that mean?

934
00:37:49,877 --> 00:37:53,416
Brian and I developed feelings
for each other.

935
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,135
We didn't mean to,
and we didn't act on it.

936
00:37:56,246 --> 00:37:58,330
But it got complicated,

937
00:37:58,416 --> 00:37:59,916
and we messed up
that deposition.

938
00:38:00,002 --> 00:38:03,495
And I know you must be thinking,
he's married, and I'm horrible.

939
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:05,393
I don't think
any of those things.

940
00:38:06,049 --> 00:38:08,627
- You don't?
- No. Things like this happen.

941
00:38:08,713 --> 00:38:09,979
I know that
as well as anyone.

942
00:38:10,065 --> 00:38:11,370
The only thing I think
about you

943
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:15,791
is that you are the same
brilliant, wonderful,

944
00:38:15,885 --> 00:38:18,654
quirky woman I've had the honor
to work with all these years.

945
00:38:18,846 --> 00:38:20,424
And that's
never gonna change.

946
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,823
- You really think that?
- Yes.

947
00:38:23,799 --> 00:38:25,505
Thank you, Louis.

948
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:28,870
Come on. Bring it in.

949
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:31,745
Unless you're worried.
If you find Brian attractive,

950
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:33,166
I can only imagine
the temptation

951
00:38:33,252 --> 00:38:34,862
that this hotness
must be aware.

952
00:38:35,944 --> 00:38:37,277
Too soon?

953
00:38:37,457 --> 00:38:38,623
No, Louis.

954
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:40,065
Right on time.

955
00:38:48,603 --> 00:38:50,721
Donna, you're calling
to get together again to night?

956
00:38:50,807 --> 00:38:52,441
Because that's never be
three nights in a row.

957
00:38:52,526 --> 00:38:54,023
<i>We might find ourselves
in trouble.</i>

958
00:38:54,108 --> 00:38:56,025
I'm not calling
to get together.

959
00:38:56,206 --> 00:38:59,096
- Hey. What's going on?
- <i>You remember when...</i>

960
00:38:59,182 --> 00:39:01,071
I said I had a work thing
on my mind,

961
00:39:01,157 --> 00:39:02,651
and I didn't wanna talk
about it?

962
00:39:02,867 --> 00:39:04,536
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

963
00:39:05,297 --> 00:39:06,870
I wanna talk about it now.

964
00:39:07,198 --> 00:39:09,565
- I'm right here.
- <i>It's not always easy</i>

965
00:39:09,651 --> 00:39:11,791
knowing what the right thing
to do is in my job,

966
00:39:11,876 --> 00:39:14,713
and it worked out this time,
but...

967
00:39:15,655 --> 00:39:17,239
Sometimes it just sucks.

968
00:39:17,417 --> 00:39:20,401
Oh, you may not believe this, Donna,
but I know exactly what you mean.

969
00:39:20,815 --> 00:39:21,872
How could you?

970
00:39:22,011 --> 00:39:23,699
<i>When Louis and Alex got me out
of that contract,</i>

971
00:39:23,784 --> 00:39:25,546
<i>it was because Larry was shady.</i>

972
00:39:25,694 --> 00:39:27,213
But what if he wasn't?

973
00:39:27,745 --> 00:39:29,713
What if it had just been
a mistake?

974
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:32,284
I'd still need them
to get me out of that contract.

975
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,315
I wouldn't care what it took,
because it was my business.

976
00:39:36,346 --> 00:39:38,485
That would've put you all
in a tough spot.

977
00:39:38,698 --> 00:39:41,948
There really is more to you
than meets the eye, isn't there?

978
00:39:42,034 --> 00:39:43,697
Anything you want to know,

979
00:39:43,783 --> 00:39:44,785
I'm right here.

980
00:39:44,871 --> 00:39:47,760
What if I wanna
get together tonight, after all?

981
00:39:48,112 --> 00:39:49,987
All that, I'd say that
maybe it's time for you

982
00:39:50,073 --> 00:39:51,432
to come over to my place.

983
00:39:52,211 --> 00:39:53,885
Give me an hour.

984
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,791
Oh, and Thomas...

985
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,635
take your vitamins.

986
00:40:11,185 --> 00:40:12,255
I'm not here right now.

987
00:40:12,341 --> 00:40:14,911
So, if you want me to call you back,
say something interesting.

988
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:18,249
Hey, I just thought we could
get a drink and celebrate.

989
00:40:18,731 --> 00:40:19,939
I leave it to you whether

990
00:40:20,025 --> 00:40:22,138

or not.
