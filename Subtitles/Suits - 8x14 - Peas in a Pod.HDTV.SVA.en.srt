1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:01,285
<i>Previously, on "Suits"...</i>

2
00:00:01,309 --> 00:00:01,858
Where have you been?

3
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:03,181
I've been looking for you
all morning.

4
00:00:03,182 --> 00:00:05,415
Okay, if you must know,
I overslept.

5
00:00:05,416 --> 00:00:07,973
- I'd love to go out again.
- Is tonight too soon?

6
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:09,874
Let me check my calendar--
Yep, I'm free.

7
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,711
You will not determine
the type of lawyer

8
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:13,990
I want to be.
- What's that supposed to mean?

9
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,114
It means I'm willing
to say I owe you one.

10
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,849
So make an enemy of me...
or not.

11
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:19,517
That's the best
you're going to get.

12
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,486
I never sent
the documents over.

13
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,598
- Are you shitting me?
- It's my fault.

14
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:24,233
- I'll take the bullet.
- They're not gonna

15
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:26,424
give a shit
whose fault this is.

16
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,227
- You must be out of your mind.
- Scottie I'm in trouble here.

17
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:31,062
- I need you to help me.
- I'm sorry, Harvey,

18
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:33,264
but I've said yes
to you to many times.

19
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,433
A year after I stopped
with my therapist,

20
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,001
I started seeing her.
- I'm guessing

21
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,703
it didn't work out.
- It was complicated.

22
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:42,273
Did Donna have anything
to do with that complication?

23
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:50,673
Still drinking sidewalk
coffee, I see.

24
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:52,309
That's because
it's the best in the city.

25
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:53,809
I don't know about that,

26
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:54,877
but their croissants
are pretty good.

27
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:56,288
Since when do you cross town
for a croissant?

28
00:00:56,312 --> 00:00:58,479
Since I had a meeting nearby
and wanted one.

29
00:00:59,345 --> 00:01:00,611
I'd ask you how you are,

30
00:01:00,646 --> 00:01:02,646
but I saw the announcement
in the Journal.

31
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:04,915
Louis as Managing Partner.
How did that happen?

32
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,605
If I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

33
00:01:06,606 --> 00:01:07,939
Does it have anything
to do with

34
00:01:07,974 --> 00:01:09,185
the two new names on the wall?
One of which I've never

35
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:11,676
even heard of before.
- Just because you never

36
00:01:11,711 --> 00:01:13,222
heard of her doesn't mean
she's not a badass.

37
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:14,985
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means the type of work

38
00:01:14,986 --> 00:01:15,961
that Samantha Wheeler did

39
00:01:15,962 --> 00:01:17,927
before she got
her name on the wall

40
00:01:17,963 --> 00:01:19,796
didn't exactly show up
in the Journal.

41
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:21,175
Now, why don't you get to
why you're here,

42
00:01:21,199 --> 00:01:22,543
because this is no chance
encounter.

43
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:23,678
Told you,
I had a meeting nearby.

44
00:01:23,702 --> 00:01:24,912
And I think that meeting's
with me because

45
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:27,871
I bet you have a case
against us.

46
00:01:27,906 --> 00:01:29,439
Well, I'm sorry, Scottie,

47
00:01:29,474 --> 00:01:30,852
but I'm not gonna let you get
in my head.

48
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:32,375
I think we both know
if I wanted to,

49
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:34,091
I could live in your head
rent-free.

50
00:01:34,092 --> 00:01:35,024
It makes you feel any better,

51
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,360
I don't have a case
against you, Harvey.

52
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:39,362
Well,
it's good to see you though.

53
00:01:39,397 --> 00:01:42,499
Maybe next time it won't
be by chance?

54
00:01:48,273 --> 00:01:49,939
Katrina.

55
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:52,142
Samantha,
are you having a nice--

56
00:01:52,177 --> 00:01:53,810
Do you mind if we skip
the chitchat?

57
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:55,478
- I'd like nothing more.
- Great.

58
00:01:55,514 --> 00:01:57,080
Because I need your help
with something.

59
00:01:57,115 --> 00:01:58,882
- With what?
- With getting out of a deal

60
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:01,050
I negotiated for
a mobile payment app

61
00:02:01,086 --> 00:02:04,420
with our client's credit card
provider.

62
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:06,122
But this is
a three-year deal

63
00:02:06,158 --> 00:02:07,957
and you're only
three months in.

64
00:02:07,993 --> 00:02:10,160
- That's what makes it fun.
- Let me get this straight.

65
00:02:10,195 --> 00:02:11,828
You want to get
out of this contract,

66
00:02:11,863 --> 00:02:13,763
you don't have any
legal grounds to do it,

67
00:02:13,798 --> 00:02:15,865
and you think I can fix
your problem for you?

68
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:17,879
What I think is if I can find
a reason to pay into a trust

69
00:02:17,903 --> 00:02:19,714
instead of to them directly,
then we can squeeze them,

70
00:02:19,738 --> 00:02:21,638
make them take a buyout.

71
00:02:21,673 --> 00:02:23,851
And if you already have that
idea, why are you coming to me?

72
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,675
Because I need precedent,
and legal minutia

73
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,343
is one of your specialties.

74
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:29,512
- In other words, I owe you.
- You sure do.

75
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:30,480
And you better come up with
something fast,

76
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:32,315
because I need something
by noon.

77
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,449
- Noon?
- Why noon?

78
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:35,952
Because I already started
paying into

79
00:02:35,987 --> 00:02:37,665
that trust yesterday,
and their douche bag attorney

80
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:39,489
moved the hearing up to today.

81
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:41,257
So unless you want
to owe me twice,

82
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:44,694
stop asking me questions and
start getting me some answers.

83
00:02:49,534 --> 00:02:51,701
Harvey, you needed to see me?

84
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:54,737
I need to know what case I
got coming up against Scottie.

85
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:56,413
As far as I know,
you don't have any cases

86
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:58,575
pending against Scottie.
- Then look again,

87
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,178
because I just ran into her
at the coffee cart.

88
00:03:02,214 --> 00:03:03,980
There's no way that was
a coincidence.

89
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:05,949
I don't know, Harvey.
The Scottie I remember

90
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:08,818
would never come at you
from the side like that.

91
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:10,364
I thought the whole point
was that you two enjoyed

92
00:03:10,388 --> 00:03:12,021
attacking each other directly.

93
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:13,556
Well, things change.

94
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,810
It looks like she's operating
out of a new playbook.

95
00:03:16,845 --> 00:03:19,046
If she is coming after us,
we need to be prepared.

96
00:03:19,081 --> 00:03:21,148
Exactly, so why don't you
drop whatever you're doing

97
00:03:21,183 --> 00:03:22,928
and figure out what case
she's got against us.

98
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,785
Consider it dropped.

99
00:03:33,529 --> 00:03:35,495
Hey, Doc, listen,
before we get going,

100
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:37,008
I just want to tell you
I may need an hour and 15--

101
00:03:37,032 --> 00:03:38,799
Holy shit, what's wrong?

102
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:40,567
Nothing, Louis,

103
00:03:40,602 --> 00:03:43,239
but I'm afraid I'm going to
have to postpone our session.

104
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,743
Stan, are you okay? Because
if you need something, there

105
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:47,811
isn't anything I wouldn't--
- I'm fine, Louis.

106
00:03:47,846 --> 00:03:49,791
It's a personal issue, and
I would rather not discuss it.

107
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:50,958
Well, I've known you
for years

108
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:52,816
and I've never seen
that look on your face,

109
00:03:52,851 --> 00:03:53,928
so me walking out of here
without knowing

110
00:03:53,952 --> 00:03:55,685
what's going on
isn't gonna happen.

111
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,588
Then if you must know,
it's a legal matter.

112
00:03:58,623 --> 00:03:59,856
What kind of legal matter?

113
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:00,790
I don't want to talk
about it.

114
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:01,891
Well, that's too bad.

115
00:04:01,927 --> 00:04:03,660
Because I can't represent you

116
00:04:03,695 --> 00:04:04,839
if you don't tell me
what happened.

117
00:04:04,863 --> 00:04:06,596
Louis,
it's out of the question.

118
00:04:06,631 --> 00:04:08,865
My personal life has nothing
to do with you.

119
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,667
Nothing to do--
Stan, don't you get it?

120
00:04:10,702 --> 00:04:13,036
I care about you.
I'm a lawyer.

121
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:14,415
And if you're in some
kind of trouble--

122
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,738
Louis, please.

123
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:18,007
This is not that serious.

124
00:04:18,043 --> 00:04:20,610
Just not every day
I'm served with papers.

125
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:23,313
So if you will be so kind
as to reschedule,

126
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:25,582
I would greatly appreciate it.

127
00:04:25,617 --> 00:04:28,318
Okay, Stan.

128
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:30,487
I'll see you next week.

First of all, Mr. Kendrick,

141
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,526
I'd like to thank you for
sitting down with us.

142
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:17,135
I know your situation's been
difficult.

143
00:05:17,136 --> 00:05:18,902
The situation
is my wife died.

144
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:21,129
- Difficult doesn't cover it.
- Of course not.

145
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,463
Can we just get on with it?

146
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:27,134
We made a few amendments
to your offer.

147
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:28,843
As you can see,
I've red-lined the sections--

148
00:05:28,844 --> 00:05:31,044
Hang on. This says we admit
it was out fault.

149
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,046
- Because it was your fault.
- No, it wasn't.

150
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:34,125
And as tragic as
this death was,

151
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:35,393
we're under no obligation
to pay anything.

152
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:37,851
- Then why are you?
- It doesn't matter why.

153
00:05:37,886 --> 00:05:39,630
I'm not admitting to something
that isn't true.

154
00:05:39,654 --> 00:05:40,732
- Tony, let me--
- No, my machines regulate

155
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:42,021
insulin better than any human,

156
00:05:42,057 --> 00:05:45,091
and I've dedicated my life
to helping people.

157
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:46,993
I'm not gonna let them say
I didn't.

158
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:49,529
Well, I dedicated my life
to caring for my wife.

159
00:05:49,564 --> 00:05:50,975
She's dead now
because of your machine.

160
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:52,643
All right, there's no need
for hostility here,

161
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:54,595
so let's calm down,
go back to the offer--

162
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:55,907
You think I care about
your offer?

163
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:58,998
No amount of money's going
to bring my wife back.

164
00:05:59,034 --> 00:06:00,611
All I care about is preventing
this from happening

165
00:06:00,635 --> 00:06:02,168
to someone else,
and that means

166
00:06:02,204 --> 00:06:04,015
making you take responsibility.
- Mr. Kendrick--

167
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:05,572
That's enough.
A woman is dead

168
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:06,406
because of
your client's product,

169
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:07,474
and if he won't admit it,

170
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:09,976
we'll make a jury admit
it for him.

171
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:12,245
This is our final offer.
Take it

172
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,647
or we'll see you in court.

173
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:22,767
Well, Ms. Wheeler, looks like
you're going to get to pay

174
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,458
into that trust after all,
because if they're not here

175
00:06:25,494 --> 00:06:27,105
in the next two minutes--
- Sorry, I'm late, Your Honor.

176
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:29,095
I had a last-minute SNAFU.

177
00:06:29,131 --> 00:06:31,364
Hold on, I thought
Larry Samuels was on this.

178
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,377
He was, but Larry's who they
call when they don't need me.

179
00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:35,335
- Dana Scott.
- Oh.

180
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,303
- Heard a lot about you.
- Have you now?

181
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:38,772
I actually used to work
at your firm

182
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:40,451
back when there were only
three names on the wall.

183
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:42,709
Now there's so many
it's hard to keep track.

184
00:06:42,744 --> 00:06:46,146
Well, after this,
you'll keep track just fine.

185
00:06:46,936 --> 00:06:49,103
Because you haven't lived up
to your obligations,

186
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:51,005
and according to these
six precedents,

187
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,607
we have the right to nullify
this entire deal right now.

188
00:06:53,643 --> 00:06:55,120
You don't have the right
to do anything.

189
00:06:55,144 --> 00:06:56,810
You're in violation of
your contract.

190
00:06:56,846 --> 00:06:58,412
Paying into a trust
isn't a violation.

191
00:06:58,447 --> 00:07:00,381
No, but meeting with
the competition is.

192
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,927
I don't know what you're
talking about.

193
00:07:01,951 --> 00:07:03,729
No, you just didn't know
I'd find out about it.

194
00:07:03,753 --> 00:07:06,687
Because that SNAFU, Your Honor,
was waiting on confirmation

195
00:07:06,722 --> 00:07:07,788
that Samantha Wheeler

196
00:07:07,823 --> 00:07:09,134
has engaged in a pattern
of dirty tricks,

197
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:12,226
unethical behavior, and
borderline illegal activity

198
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:14,695
all in the name of
"representing" her clients.

199
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,774
And you're gonna say that
about me,

200
00:07:15,798 --> 00:07:18,566
better damn well be able
to back it up,

201
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:19,700
which you can't.

202
00:07:19,735 --> 00:07:22,703
Here are three of
Ms. Wheeler's old cases,

203
00:07:22,738 --> 00:07:24,705
and then you'll find
payments forced,

204
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,885
settlements withheld, and
meetings with the competition

205
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:28,409
just like she did last week.

206
00:07:28,444 --> 00:07:29,910
How the hell did
you get those?

207
00:07:29,946 --> 00:07:31,879
Doesn't like you're denying
they're true.

208
00:07:31,914 --> 00:07:33,859
Ms. Wheeler, did you meet
with the competition last week?

209
00:07:33,883 --> 00:07:36,483
Your Honor, my past cases
have no relevance here.

210
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,686
No, but your answers
to my questions do.

211
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:40,287
Did you meet with them?

212
00:07:40,323 --> 00:07:41,722
Yes, but--

213
00:07:41,757 --> 00:07:43,791
You came into my chambers
ready to lie

214
00:07:43,826 --> 00:07:45,759
and cheat
and God knows what else,

215
00:07:45,795 --> 00:07:47,728
so you are going to dissolve
that trust,

216
00:07:47,763 --> 00:07:49,863
you're gonna pay her client
the money you owe them,

217
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:51,532
and I don't ever want
to see you

218
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:54,802
in my chambers
on this case again.

219
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,086
All right, Tony,
it's just you and me now.

220
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:01,266
Please tell me you're 100% sure
this wasn't your machine.

221
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,757
Alex, have anyone in
the world test my machines,

222
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:05,859
every reports gonna say
the same thing.

223
00:08:05,895 --> 00:08:07,361
That woman's death
wasn't our fault.

224
00:08:07,396 --> 00:08:09,129
Then what else could have
caused it?

225
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:10,942
Because you heard that man.
We're going to trial.

226
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:12,944
This doesn't have to go to
trial, Alex, and you know it.

227
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:17,237
Just like we both know
what caused her death.

228
00:08:17,273 --> 00:08:19,039
- Shit.
- Yeah, I know.

229
00:08:19,075 --> 00:08:21,742
It was him, and we're gonna
have to prove it.

230
00:08:21,777 --> 00:08:24,611
The question is

231
00:08:24,647 --> 00:08:27,114
when the time comes,
are you gonna have the stomach

232
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:30,984
to do what needs to be done?

233
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:35,489
No, no, not right now, Donna.
I'm in the middle of something.

234
00:08:35,524 --> 00:08:37,336
Well, I'm in the middle of
something for Harvey,

235
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,304
but these quarterly reports
aren't gonna sign themselves.

236
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:42,763
Well, put them
right over there.

237
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:45,265
"Boyd versus Lipschitz"?

238
00:08:45,301 --> 00:08:47,735
- Lipschitz as in Dr. Lipschitz?
- Yes.

239
00:08:48,284 --> 00:08:50,684
He's being sued, and he tried
to make it like it was nothing,

240
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,319
but then I pulled
his legal filing and--

241
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:53,888
- And it's not nothing.
- No, it's not.

242
00:08:53,923 --> 00:08:56,023
One of his patients
is a construction foreman,

243
00:08:56,058 --> 00:08:58,549
had a meltdown at work,
there was an accident,

244
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,051
put someone in a coma,
and now he claims it

245
00:09:01,086 --> 00:09:03,231
only happened because Lipschitz
prescribed the wrong meds.

246
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:05,088
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, gets worse.

247
00:09:05,123 --> 00:09:07,557
Instead of coming to me,
he went to Dick Horman.

248
00:09:07,592 --> 00:09:09,537
They lose this case, Donna,
he could lose his license.

249
00:09:09,561 --> 00:09:11,227
Wait a second,
are you talking about

250
00:09:11,263 --> 00:09:12,774
trying to convince Lipschitz
to let you represent him?

251
00:09:12,798 --> 00:09:14,909
Yes, Donna, and I know you're
gonna tell me it's a bad idea.

252
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:16,132
It's not a bad idea, Louis.

253
00:09:16,168 --> 00:09:18,468
If someone I cared about was
in a similar situation,

254
00:09:18,503 --> 00:09:21,338
wild horses wouldn't stop me
from trying to protect them.

255
00:09:21,373 --> 00:09:23,217
How could I not support you
in doing the same thing?

256
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:24,908
- You really mean that?
- Of course I do.

257
00:09:24,943 --> 00:09:26,421
Well, then what do you say
you help me figure out a way

258
00:09:26,445 --> 00:09:29,746
to convince Stan
to let me take his case.

259
00:09:32,017 --> 00:09:33,995
- Samantha, how'd it go?
- I'll tell you how it went.

260
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:35,418
I got my ass handed to me

261
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:37,787
because they found out about
our meeting with their rival.

262
00:09:37,823 --> 00:09:40,102
What meeting? You didn't
tell me about any meeting.

263
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:41,602
I didn't tell anyone,

264
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:44,338
which mean there's no way
they could have found out

265
00:09:44,374 --> 00:09:47,275
unless they put someone
in their competitor's office.

266
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,350
I don't know, Samantha.
That sounds kind of extreme.

267
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:52,213
No, Katrina, it sounds shady,
and in my experience,

268
00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:53,859
the other side only does
something like that

269
00:09:53,883 --> 00:09:56,264
when they have already done
something even shadier.

270
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:57,731
So you think
they're hiding something

271
00:09:57,766 --> 00:09:59,578
and you're gonna find it.
- No, we're gonna find it.

272
00:09:59,602 --> 00:10:00,779
Because there's no way in hell

273
00:10:00,803 --> 00:10:04,204
I'm gonna let Dana Scott
get the better of me.

274
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,173
- Wait, who?
- Dana Scott.

275
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,108
I know she used to work here
or something.

276
00:10:08,143 --> 00:10:12,112
- She didn't just work here.
- What does that mean?

277
00:10:12,147 --> 00:10:14,081
I'm not sure it's really
my place to--

278
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:17,284
Katrina,
do I have to say it again?

279
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:18,619
You owe me.

280
00:10:18,654 --> 00:10:22,089
She and Harvey were together,

281
00:10:22,124 --> 00:10:24,424
so if she knows things
she shouldn't,

282
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,460
he's the first place I'd look.

283
00:10:29,238 --> 00:10:30,304
Hey, Harvey.

284
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:32,573
Dick over any of
your partners lately?

285
00:10:32,608 --> 00:10:34,308
Samantha,
nice weather we're having.

286
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:36,410
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yeah, and I ignored it

287
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:38,290
because I have no idea what
you're talking about.

288
00:10:38,314 --> 00:10:39,324
The name Dana Scott
ring any bells?

289
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:41,214
Because you just helped her

290
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,283
make me look like a sleazebag
in front of a judge.

291
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:45,452
Slow your roll, Tiger.
I didn't help her do anything.

292
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:49,256
All I said was, "You're
a badass and sometimes..."

293
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,525
Sometimes what?
I work in the gray?

294
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,060
Because she used
that against me.

295
00:10:53,095 --> 00:10:54,339
All right,
I guess I did give her that,

296
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:55,996
but I didn't do it to help her.

297
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,465
Well, whether you meant
to help her or not, you did.

298
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,835
So how about leveling the field
and helping the home team?

299
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,337
No way.
I'm not getting involved.

300
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,883
- Why not?
- Because it'll just make her

301
00:11:04,907 --> 00:11:06,840
want to win all the more.

302
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,409
Oh. So you're that
kind of guy.

303
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:10,944
What kind of guy?

304
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,548
Handsome, powerful men--
goes one of two ways.

305
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:15,493
You either want a woman who
doesn't challenge you at all

306
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:18,385
or you want one who challenges
you all the time.

307
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,631
I'm sorry,
I stopped listening after

308
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:21,822
the handsome
and powerful part.

309
00:11:21,857 --> 00:11:23,390
The thing is, Harvey,

310
00:11:23,425 --> 00:11:25,459
with someone who challenges
you all the time,

311
00:11:25,494 --> 00:11:28,262
there's always
unfinished business.

312
00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:30,197
This is your chance
to finish it.

313
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:33,528
No, Samantha, this is just a
chance to rip open an old scar,

314
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:35,096
and I'm not doing it.

315
00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:36,297
Well,
she just ripped me open,

316
00:11:36,332 --> 00:11:39,266
and I'm gonna do whatever
it takes to return the favor.

317
00:11:39,302 --> 00:11:40,701
You don't want to help me,
don't,

318
00:11:40,737 --> 00:11:43,804
but you sure as hell better
stop helping her.

319
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:56,646
- Katrina.
- Harvey.

320
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:59,716
- What are you doing in here?
- Just having a coffee.

321
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:01,417
No, you're here
because you know

322
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:03,252
I'm working with Samantha
in her office

323
00:12:03,691 --> 00:12:05,991
and you don't want her
to hear what you have to say.

324
00:12:06,027 --> 00:12:08,227
What if I don't?
You gonna tell her about this?

325
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:11,730
I guess that depends
on exactly what it is you want.

326
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:13,543
I want to know if there's
a deal to be had here.

327
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,114
I don't know. Right now,
Samantha is so pissed

328
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:17,748
I don't think
she'd take anything less

329
00:12:17,783 --> 00:12:18,860
than an outright win.
- And on top of that,

330
00:12:18,884 --> 00:12:20,984
Samantha won't stop looking
for leverage

331
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,954
until she finds something
that gives her the upper hand.

332
00:12:23,989 --> 00:12:25,922
Pretty much, yeah.

333
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,592
Tell me this...

334
00:12:28,627 --> 00:12:31,094
what would a compromise
look like?

335
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:35,863
Louis, what are you doing?

336
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:37,665
I'll tell you
what I'm not doing.

337
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,901
I'm not leaving until you sign
this engagement letter.

338
00:12:39,936 --> 00:12:42,270
I told you,
I have the matter handled.

339
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:43,504
By Dick Corman

340
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:46,274
who couldn't handle his way
out of a paper bag.

341
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:48,554
Now either you let me do this
or you tell me what's going on,

342
00:12:48,578 --> 00:12:49,755
but I'm a better lawyer
than this guy.

343
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:51,913
- Louis, please.
- Stan, don't you believe

344
00:12:51,948 --> 00:12:53,781
that I'm great at what I do?

345
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:54,782
Because if I thought
you didn't think that,

346
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:56,003
I wouldn't have seen you
all these years.

347
00:12:56,004 --> 00:12:58,054
I do believe you're great
at what you do,

348
00:12:58,055 --> 00:12:59,421
but you overreact.

349
00:12:59,457 --> 00:13:01,957
Particularly when it involves
people you care about.

350
00:13:01,993 --> 00:13:04,360
God damn it, Stan,
your career is on the line.

351
00:13:04,395 --> 00:13:07,296
You hire me, you have my word
that won't happen.

352
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:10,099
I am well aware my career
is on the line, Louis.

353
00:13:10,134 --> 00:13:11,834
It is all I can think about.

354
00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:13,302
Well, then think about this.

355
00:13:13,337 --> 00:13:16,372
How many times have you told me
that I get in my own way?

356
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:18,274
Well, now you're getting
in yours,

357
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:20,209
because I am the best man
for this job

358
00:13:20,244 --> 00:13:22,678
and deep down you know it.

359
00:13:25,077 --> 00:13:29,046
Okay, Louis,
you can represent me,

360
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:30,814
but under one condition.

361
00:13:30,849 --> 00:13:32,616
I just told you I'll keep
myself in check.

362
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:36,319
No, Louis.
One other condition.

363
00:13:38,857 --> 00:13:41,391
- Thanks, Bill.
- Who's Bill?

364
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:43,794
Just one of my many lovers
calling to say hi.

365
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:46,396
Or your doorman calling to
say he's got your dry cleaning.

366
00:13:46,432 --> 00:13:47,697
Why can't he be both?

367
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:49,466
Now why don't you tell me
what you're doing

368
00:13:49,501 --> 00:13:50,667
in enemy territory.

369
00:13:50,702 --> 00:13:52,702
See, that's the thing,
Scottie.

370
00:13:52,738 --> 00:13:56,773
You're an opponent.
You're not an enemy.

371
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:59,543
I don't want to see
you get hurt.

372
00:14:00,262 --> 00:14:01,728
- What is that?
- A way out.

373
00:14:01,764 --> 00:14:03,530
We buy your client
at a fair price,

374
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:05,699
they make a fortune,
everybody comes out ahead.

375
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:07,145
I don't believe it.
I win the championship

376
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:08,902
and you want me to share
the trophy?

377
00:14:08,937 --> 00:14:10,504
You didn't win anything yet,

378
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:12,672
and she's not letting this go.
- So what?

379
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,608
So you two are on
a collision course,

380
00:14:14,643 --> 00:14:17,511
and it isn't gonna be pretty.
- I didn't pick this fight.

381
00:14:17,546 --> 00:14:20,981
But you escalated it by using
information you got from me

382
00:14:21,016 --> 00:14:22,883
to go personal against
my partner.

383
00:14:22,918 --> 00:14:24,763
I did what I had to do on
behalf of my client.

384
00:14:24,787 --> 00:14:26,620
Well, Samantha's
gonna do what she has to

385
00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:29,422
and trust me,
what she's willing to do

386
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:32,526
isn't something
you want a piece of.

387
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:34,995
Does she even know
about this?

388
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,331
I should have known.
Get out of my office, Harvey.

389
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:39,499
I don't believe this.

390
00:14:39,535 --> 00:14:42,269
You lie to my face about taking
a case against me,

391
00:14:42,304 --> 00:14:44,504
and now you're upset
that I don't have

392
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,473
Samantha's approval
before coming over here?

393
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:48,620
I said that I didn't have
a case against you, not her.

394
00:14:48,644 --> 00:14:50,610
Well, now you do have
a case against me

395
00:14:50,646 --> 00:14:53,413
whether you like it or not,
because I gave you that offer,

396
00:14:53,448 --> 00:14:56,072
which means you have to
present it to your client.

397
00:14:56,073 --> 00:14:58,333
You are not one of the
attorneys listed on this case.

398
00:14:58,334 --> 00:14:59,667
I do not have to present
anything,

399
00:14:59,702 --> 00:15:01,969
and even if I did,
I can tell you what they'd say.

400
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:02,937
- "Go to hell."
- Scottie--

401
00:15:02,972 --> 00:15:04,505
Thank you for the warning,
Harvey,

402
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,074
but I'm doing just fine.

403
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,877
Okay, have it your way,
but don't come crying to me

404
00:15:09,913 --> 00:15:12,447
when she figures out
how to turn the tables.

405
00:15:23,178 --> 00:15:26,746
- Hello?
<i>- Samantha, it's Dana Scott.</i>

406
00:15:26,782 --> 00:15:29,115
Dana,
to what do I owe the pleasure?

407
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:32,418
Look, we got off
on the wrong foot today.

408
00:15:32,454 --> 00:15:34,766
You obviously don't want to be
in business with us anymore,

409
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,423
so I came up with a compromise.
- I'm listening.

410
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:39,659
<i>You honor your contract</i>
<i>for the next 18 months</i>

411
00:15:39,694 --> 00:15:41,795
and reduce your fees
every quarter after that,

412
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,664
and we won't enforce
our exclusivity clause.

413
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,733
I get it--you get to keep
your revenue stream

414
00:15:46,768 --> 00:15:48,501
so your earnings
don't take a hit,

415
00:15:48,537 --> 00:15:51,838
and we get to quietly
pursue a new partnership.

416
00:15:51,873 --> 00:15:54,307
Plus, you save the backlash
from me telling the judge

417
00:15:54,342 --> 00:15:57,277
that you're still working
on this--like I know you are.

418
00:15:57,312 --> 00:15:59,579
I gotta say...
it's a pretty good move.

419
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:03,737
And under other circumstances,
you'd have yourself a deal.

420
00:16:03,772 --> 00:16:05,905
<i>- What other circumstances?</i>
- One where there wasn't

421
00:16:05,941 --> 00:16:07,674
more going on here
than meets the eye.

422
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:09,275
There's nothing else
going on here.

423
00:16:09,311 --> 00:16:10,176
Save it.
You're coming to me

424
00:16:10,212 --> 00:16:12,879
with a compromise
when you have me?

425
00:16:12,914 --> 00:16:15,448
You did something here,
and I'm gonna find it.

426
00:16:15,484 --> 00:16:16,594
What makes you think I won't
find out more on you?

427
00:16:16,618 --> 00:16:17,550
Because it took me
barely an hour

428
00:16:17,586 --> 00:16:19,819
to find out
what I already did.

429
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:22,789
I think playing dirty
isn't your specialty.

430
00:16:22,824 --> 00:16:24,424
You took a walk
on the wild side,

431
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:27,060
and turns out you
fucked with the wrong marine.

432
00:16:27,095 --> 00:16:28,601
- Listen to me--
<i>- Sorry, Dana.</i>

433
00:16:28,602 --> 00:16:30,168
I'm done listening

434
00:16:30,203 --> 00:16:32,637
because I got to get back
to looking.

435
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:36,608
Gretchen, need something?

436
00:16:36,643 --> 00:16:39,077
The report on that diabetes
machine came in.

437
00:16:39,112 --> 00:16:40,645
Why are you
bringing me this?

438
00:16:40,681 --> 00:16:43,281
Because I know you're gonna
use it to attack that husband.

439
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:45,461
Gretchen, if you're here to
tell me not to go after him,

440
00:16:45,485 --> 00:16:46,896
I'm already twisted up
about it anyway.

441
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,720
As someone whose husband
died of diabetes,

442
00:16:48,755 --> 00:16:50,522
I'm telling you
do what you have to do.

443
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:51,601
Your husband
died of diabetes?

444
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,826
He did.
And that man is grieving.

445
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:57,762
He's looking for an answer,
and I can't blame him,

446
00:16:57,798 --> 00:16:59,631
but without machines
like that one,

447
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:03,168
my Carl wouldn't have lived
as long as he did.

448
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,373
Hey, how did you even know
about this case?

449
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:12,836
Well, we never really
discussed the client you lost

450
00:17:12,837 --> 00:17:14,504
because of me.
- We didn't need to.

451
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:16,199
They never should have
asked me to let you go,

452
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,344
and I never would have
done it anyway.

453
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:20,202
All the same,
I never thanked you

454
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:22,405
'cause I didn't know how.

455
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,817
So you were keeping tabs
on my cases

456
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:25,408
waiting for a way to help.

457
00:17:25,443 --> 00:17:27,176
I know it really
isn't helping, but--

458
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:29,089
Gretchen, you just showed me
it was okay to do something

459
00:17:29,113 --> 00:17:31,380
I never thought I'd have to do.

460
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:34,283
If that isn't help,
I don't know what is.

461
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,186
Thanks, Alex.

462
00:17:43,027 --> 00:17:45,227
All right,
we've been at this for hours.

463
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:46,929
It's getting us nowhere.

464
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,075
We need to shake down
some employees.

465
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:50,399
And that's all well and good,
but if we don't know

466
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:52,046
what to ask, we're not
going to get any answers.

467
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,336
Yes, we will.

468
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:55,338
They don't know
what we don't know.

469
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:56,906
They don't know
what we don't know.

470
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:57,952
Yeah,
that's what I just said.

471
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,509
No, Samantha, I'm saying
according to this report

472
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:03,145
their accounts are growing
by 200% a month.

473
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:04,880
Wait a second,
if that's true,

474
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,694
why are they clinging
to this deal like a life raft?

475
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:10,720
Because maybe they're not
really growing by 200% a month.

476
00:18:12,957 --> 00:18:14,824
Look.

477
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:16,859
February...

478
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:18,794
5 million new users,

479
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,364
but 60% didn't meet
the transaction threshold,

480
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:22,798
parsing a likelihood
of the fact--

481
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:24,266
Katrina, English.

482
00:18:24,302 --> 00:18:27,403
60% of these card holders

483
00:18:27,438 --> 00:18:31,540
don't even seem to know
they have the cards.

484
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:32,608
Holy shit.

485
00:18:32,643 --> 00:18:36,379
The people are real,
but the accounts are fake.

486
00:18:36,414 --> 00:18:38,481
This isn't just shady,
this is the type of shit

487
00:18:38,516 --> 00:18:40,516
that lands someone in prison.

488
00:18:43,654 --> 00:18:47,189
- Wait till the judge sees this.
- The judge?

489
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:49,458
Why don't you just leverage
them into letting us out?

490
00:18:49,494 --> 00:18:51,260
Because I have
the upper hand now.

491
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:52,973
I'm not giving her
a chance to get it back.

492
00:18:52,997 --> 00:18:54,408
Samantha, if she has anything
to do with this,

493
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:55,631
it would ruin her.

494
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:56,777
And if she didn't want
to be ruined,

495
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:59,035
she shouldn't have gotten
involved in this,

496
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,938
and she damn sure shouldn't
have fucked with me.

497
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:06,142
I want everything you have
ready for court in 36 hours.

498
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,279
Scottie,
what are you doing here?

499
00:19:17,315 --> 00:19:18,874
I need to know if
Samantha Wheeler

500
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,019
is really the attack dog
Harvey says she is.

501
00:19:20,043 --> 00:19:21,086
No, I heard about you
tricking Harvey

502
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,544
into giving you information.

503
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,990
I'm not gonna let you
do the same thing to me.

504
00:19:25,014 --> 00:19:26,881
This is not about tricking
you, Donna.

505
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,983
This is about me
staying out of prison.

506
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:30,584
What?

507
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,586
Please.

508
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:47,468
My clients have been creating
fake accounts.

509
00:19:47,503 --> 00:19:50,237
I found out about it, and I've
been helping them cover it up.

510
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,372
- How could you--
- I know.

511
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:53,841
I put a stop to it, but if
I can buy them some time,

512
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:55,009
they can dig themselves out,

513
00:19:55,044 --> 00:19:57,445
and hundreds of good people
can keep their jobs.

514
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,948
Scottie, what exactly are you
here to ask me?

515
00:20:00,984 --> 00:20:01,849
I want you to convince Harvey

516
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:04,518
to make Samantha
honor that contract.

517
00:20:04,554 --> 00:20:06,087
Are you crazy?

518
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,088
With a company
that's committed fraud?

519
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,457
They're making up for
the fake accounts,

520
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:11,225
but they lose their contract,
they go under,

521
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,694
and everything comes out.

522
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:17,865
Okay, let's say
that I believe you.

523
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,833
Why are you coming to me
and not Harvey?

524
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:20,868
Because he came to me
with a deal

525
00:20:20,903 --> 00:20:22,448
and I told him to go to hell.
- Why would you do that?

526
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:24,739
Because if we take that deal,
they open up the books

527
00:20:24,774 --> 00:20:26,640
and everything
comes out anyway.

528
00:20:26,676 --> 00:20:28,554
And that all sounds great,
but Harvey's gonna find out

529
00:20:28,578 --> 00:20:30,422
one way or the other,
and you want me to tell him

530
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:32,317
instead of telling
him yourself.

531
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:33,951
So what the hell is really
going on?

532
00:20:33,986 --> 00:20:36,320
Okay, fine,
you want the truth?

533
00:20:39,091 --> 00:20:41,458
I'm ashamed of what I did,

534
00:20:41,494 --> 00:20:43,327
and maybe I
wouldn't have done it

535
00:20:43,362 --> 00:20:46,063
if it didn't save those jobs,
but maybe I would have...

536
00:20:46,098 --> 00:20:48,165
because I signed that company.

537
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,134
I put my ass on the line
for them,

538
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:51,835
and I wasn't going
to let them fail.

539
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:53,050
And if that's the case,
Harvey would

540
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,351
definitely understand because

541
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,253
he's done the exact
same thing himself.

542
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,988
Maybe he would,
but I need him to do this,

543
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,089
and let's face it.

544
00:20:59,124 --> 00:20:59,923
For a long time now,
you've had a lot more

545
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,993
sway over him than me.

546
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:06,830
I convince him to help you.

547
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,766
From now on,
you steer clear of our firm.

548
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,101
You mean
steer clear of Harvey.

549
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:12,969
I said what I meant,
Scottie.

550
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:16,006
Yes or no?

551
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,025
- Mr. Grant, you have a moment?
- Actually, no.

552
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:22,336
Yeah, I don't care.
My name is Louis Litt,

553
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,503
and I'm representing
Dr. Stanley Lipschitz.

554
00:21:24,504 --> 00:21:26,370
I thought Dick Corman
was representing--

555
00:21:26,405 --> 00:21:28,250
You thought you got lucky and
Dick Corman was handling this.

556
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:30,441
Well, unfortunately for you,
the big dogs are here.

557
00:21:30,476 --> 00:21:32,710
Well, they better be here
with a big, fat settlement

558
00:21:32,745 --> 00:21:34,122
'cause my client lost
his livelihood

559
00:21:34,146 --> 00:21:35,112
due to your client's mistake.

560
00:21:35,147 --> 00:21:36,080
Your client lost
his livelihood

561
00:21:36,115 --> 00:21:38,616
because he had
a manic episode at work.

562
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:40,229
And I have 50 years of
precedent that says

563
00:21:40,253 --> 00:21:41,519
you cannot blame a doctor

564
00:21:41,554 --> 00:21:43,554
for reasonably prescribing
medication.

565
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:45,322
Now normally,
I would walk in here and say

566
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:47,658
I've got you by the balls,
squeeze a little tighter

567
00:21:47,693 --> 00:21:49,271
until you beg me for mercy,
but I'm not gonna do that.

568
00:21:49,295 --> 00:21:50,861
- Oh, no?
- No.

569
00:21:50,897 --> 00:21:52,574
I'm gonna offer you
a reasonable settlement

570
00:21:52,598 --> 00:21:54,343
that you're gonna take,
because there's not one person

571
00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:57,635
on the planet that believes
my client was at fault here.

572
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,104
Actually,
there is one person.

573
00:22:00,139 --> 00:22:03,040
And he just happens to be the
leading expert in the field.

574
00:22:03,075 --> 00:22:04,119
So you're gonna take whatever
you're offer was

575
00:22:04,143 --> 00:22:07,845
and add two more zeroes,
because I got you, asshole,

576
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,114
and that testimony proves it.
- It proves nothing,

577
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:11,894
and when I get through
with your so-called expert,

578
00:22:11,918 --> 00:22:13,884
all the jury's gonna see
is a quack who is willing

579
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,687
to sell his testimony
to the highest bidder.

580
00:22:16,722 --> 00:22:18,923
I'll see you in court.

581
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:22,592
Mr. Kendrick,
did your wife

582
00:22:22,627 --> 00:22:24,427
manage her insulin levels
all by herself?

583
00:22:24,462 --> 00:22:26,664
No, her doctor set
her base levels,

584
00:22:26,665 --> 00:22:27,876
and I monitored
her daily needs.

585
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,798
And isn't it true
you recently changed

586
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:31,001
the brand of cartridge
you used?

587
00:22:31,036 --> 00:22:33,136
Yes, we tried the newest one
on the market,

588
00:22:33,172 --> 00:22:34,349
but your machine said
it would accommodate.

589
00:22:34,373 --> 00:22:36,740
And it does,
but it also requires

590
00:22:36,775 --> 00:22:39,576
the overnight dosage time
to be manually set by the user.

591
00:22:39,611 --> 00:22:41,344
- Who did that?
- I did.

592
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,224
And I set the machine for
2:00 a.m. like always.

593
00:22:43,248 --> 00:22:44,526
Then why did the machine
not deliver the dosage

594
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,483
until 3:00 a.m.?
- I don't know.

595
00:22:46,518 --> 00:22:48,785
- Why don't you ask your client?
- I have.

596
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,288
I've also asked an expert third
party to check the machine.

597
00:22:51,323 --> 00:22:53,023
And they both said
it was working fine,

598
00:22:53,058 --> 00:22:54,791
yet that dose wasn't delivered
until 3:00.

599
00:22:54,826 --> 00:22:56,359
- Is there a question here?
- Yes.

600
00:22:56,395 --> 00:22:57,861
Is it possible, Mr. Kendrick,

601
00:22:57,896 --> 00:22:59,007
that you set the machine
for 3:00 a.m.?

602
00:22:59,031 --> 00:23:00,931
- No, absolutely not.
- How can you be sure?

603
00:23:00,966 --> 00:23:03,300
Because I double-checked
the time.

604
00:23:03,335 --> 00:23:05,268
I always double-check the time,
and it said 2:00.

605
00:23:05,304 --> 00:23:07,549
- When did you double-check it?
- Right before we went to bed.

606
00:23:07,573 --> 00:23:09,050
- And what time was that?
- I don't remember--

607
00:23:09,074 --> 00:23:10,807
You don't remember the time,

608
00:23:10,842 --> 00:23:12,287
but you remember checking
the machine.

609
00:23:12,311 --> 00:23:14,144
Yes, I do, and it was
probably around 10:00.

610
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:16,595
So it was late.
You were tired.

611
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:18,629
- That doesn't mean--
- You could make a mistake?

612
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:20,364
Why not?
Because you're perfect?

613
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,233
You're a computer?
A machine?

614
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,268
- That's not fair!
- No, what's not fair

615
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:26,137
is you blaming my client
for your mistake,

616
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:27,516
because there are only
two factors here--

617
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,040
that machine and you.

618
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,519
And when I present all this
plus the fact

619
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:33,010
there is no instance
of our machine ever failing,

620
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:34,912
even if the jury finds
in your favor,

621
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:36,358
the judge will throw it out
as a matter of law.

622
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:38,983
I checked that time.
I see it in my mind,

623
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:41,819
and you are never going
to tell me different.

624
00:23:45,982 --> 00:23:47,159
How low can you be
to pin this on him?

625
00:23:47,183 --> 00:23:49,095
Don't give me that.
My client started this company

626
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,818
because his own family
needed it,

627
00:23:50,854 --> 00:23:52,820
and the world's
a better place because he did.

628
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:54,989
We gave you an offer.
It still stands.

629
00:23:55,025 --> 00:23:57,158
I'd advise your client
to take it.

630
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:05,562
Harvey,
we need to talk about Scottie.

631
00:24:05,597 --> 00:24:07,564
- No, we don't.
- Yeah, we do,

632
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,077
because this isn't just
the usual case of you two

633
00:24:09,101 --> 00:24:10,634
screwing each other over
for fun.

634
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:12,903
- She's--
- I know.

635
00:24:12,938 --> 00:24:14,604
She's involved
in some shady shit.

636
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,607
You know? How?

637
00:24:17,643 --> 00:24:19,142
Doesn't matter how.

638
00:24:19,178 --> 00:24:20,755
Okay, then what are you gonna
do about it?

639
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:22,512
I'm not gonna do anything
about it.

640
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:24,648
She had every chance
to ask for help,

641
00:24:24,683 --> 00:24:26,394
she didn't, and when
I came to her with a deal,

642
00:24:26,418 --> 00:24:28,285
she told me to go to hell.
- Yeah,

643
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,231
because if she took that deal,
it would all come out.

644
00:24:30,255 --> 00:24:32,556
Well, it's all gonna
come out now anyway.

645
00:24:32,591 --> 00:24:34,658
I don't believe this.

646
00:24:34,693 --> 00:24:36,459
What is wrong with you?

647
00:24:36,495 --> 00:24:37,994
She's only in this mess
because

648
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,729
she tried to save
people's jobs,

649
00:24:39,765 --> 00:24:41,309
and you might have done
the exact same thing.

650
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:42,877
Why the hell are you even
defending her?

651
00:24:42,901 --> 00:24:45,435
- Why shouldn't I defend her?
- Because you've always been--

652
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,871
Been what?

653
00:24:47,906 --> 00:24:50,040
Afraid to say it?

654
00:24:50,075 --> 00:24:52,175
Yeah, that's not a surprise.

655
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,725
Well, Harvey,
believe it or not,

656
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,927
I care about her.

657
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,595
And every time
we've ever needed her

658
00:24:58,631 --> 00:24:59,830
she's been there for us.

659
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,398
Not last year with
Stanley Gordon.

660
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:02,399
Maybe not every time,

661
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,334
but when it was
you on the line or Mike,

662
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,914
she was there for us.
And in case you forgot,

663
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:08,138
you basically did the exact
same thing with Teddy Doyle,

664
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,340
and not a week ago you
came to me to save your ass

665
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:12,109
just like she did this morning.

666
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:14,077
You two are peas in a pod,
you always have been.

667
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:17,447
And for a guy who says
loyalty is a two-way street...

668
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:19,249
you sure as hell
aren't acting like it.

669
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:20,984
Because we aren't
two peas in a pod.

670
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,453
She's supposed
to be better than me.

671
00:25:24,312 --> 00:25:26,946
- Harvey.
- Donna, she did this.

672
00:25:26,981 --> 00:25:28,058
She didn't even tell me
about it,

673
00:25:28,082 --> 00:25:30,082
and now I'm supposed to make
my new partner,

674
00:25:30,118 --> 00:25:31,951
who I unknowingly sold out,

675
00:25:31,986 --> 00:25:36,288
take it easy...on the person
I sold her out to.

676
00:25:36,324 --> 00:25:39,425
And I understand all that,
but if it were me,

677
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,495
I'd get Samantha
to back off anyway.

678
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:49,199
Gretchen,
can I talk to you for a second?

679
00:25:49,234 --> 00:25:50,200
About what?

680
00:25:50,235 --> 00:25:52,369
About how it went with
our plaintiff today.

681
00:25:52,404 --> 00:25:53,970
Of course, what happened?

682
00:25:54,006 --> 00:25:55,556
I hammered him
again and again,

683
00:25:55,557 --> 00:25:57,754
but it didn't matter.
He stuck to his story

684
00:25:57,755 --> 00:25:58,587
and said he didn't care
what I said

685
00:25:58,622 --> 00:26:01,323
or the machine said
or that report said.

686
00:26:01,358 --> 00:26:03,125
He checked the time,
and it was 2:00 a.m.

687
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,227
Alex, what are you looking
for me to tell you?

688
00:26:05,262 --> 00:26:06,762
You made a mistake with me

689
00:26:06,797 --> 00:26:08,074
you never thought
you could make.

690
00:26:08,098 --> 00:26:08,990
I guess I'm looking
for you to say

691
00:26:08,991 --> 00:26:11,224
the same thing
must have happened here.

692
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:13,226
- I can't tell you that.
- Why not?

693
00:26:13,261 --> 00:26:15,728
Because I never followed up
with that messenger.

694
00:26:15,764 --> 00:26:18,798
That was my mistake,
never following up.

695
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:20,833
But he's saying that he did
follow up,

696
00:26:20,869 --> 00:26:22,535
and if that's the case,

697
00:26:22,571 --> 00:26:24,571
you painted that man as guilty
when he wasn't.

698
00:26:24,606 --> 00:26:26,306
And all that bullshit I said

699
00:26:26,341 --> 00:26:30,643
about it being worth it
goes out the window.

700
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:32,412
All right.

701
00:26:32,447 --> 00:26:35,014
- I need some time to think.
- No.

702
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,350
You need someone to help you
sort through this mess

703
00:26:37,385 --> 00:26:40,253
and figure out
what's going on here.

704
00:26:46,691 --> 00:26:49,025
Alex, what are you doing?

705
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,404
Couldn't wait till tomorrow
to bill me?

706
00:26:50,428 --> 00:26:53,730
I wish that's why I was here,
Tony.

707
00:26:53,765 --> 00:26:55,732
But something James said
didn't sit right with me,

708
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:57,867
so...I went back through
everything,

709
00:26:57,902 --> 00:26:59,602
and I found this.
- What is that?

710
00:26:59,637 --> 00:27:02,371
Turns out the software update
on those new cartridges,

711
00:27:02,407 --> 00:27:04,006
the ones James used--

712
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:08,319
Glitched for exactly 12
minutes between 9:43 and 9:55.

713
00:27:08,354 --> 00:27:09,398
The exact window
which I suspect

714
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:11,789
Anne Kendrick's machine reset.

715
00:27:11,825 --> 00:27:13,391
Fuck.

716
00:27:13,426 --> 00:27:15,860
Tony, I've got to ask.
Did you know about this?

717
00:27:15,895 --> 00:27:18,062
You know me a long time,
Alex.

718
00:27:18,098 --> 00:27:19,108
How can you accuse me
of that?

719
00:27:19,132 --> 00:27:20,176
I'm not accusing you
of anything,

720
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,233
but I need to know the truth.

721
00:27:22,268 --> 00:27:23,134
Well, the truth is
I didn't know about

722
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:25,303
this until eight second ago.

723
00:27:25,338 --> 00:27:26,348
And if you hadn't been looking
where you shouldn't of,

724
00:27:26,372 --> 00:27:28,406
you wouldn't either.
- What does that mean?

725
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:30,475
It means I need you to
pretend you never saw this.

726
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,477
Tony, a woman is dead.

727
00:27:32,512 --> 00:27:34,145
Well, this isn't
gonna bring her back,

728
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,191
and she was
the only person harmed.

729
00:27:35,215 --> 00:27:37,949
No, she was not.
Her husband lost his wife

730
00:27:37,984 --> 00:27:38,994
and I as much as told him
he killed her

731
00:27:39,018 --> 00:27:40,262
so you can keep making
this machine.

732
00:27:40,286 --> 00:27:41,152
And I don't keep making
this machine,

733
00:27:41,187 --> 00:27:43,321
how many people
are gonna die?

734
00:27:43,356 --> 00:27:44,188
Because I shouldn't have
to remind you

735
00:27:44,224 --> 00:27:45,790
we don't make sunglasses.

736
00:27:45,825 --> 00:27:46,657
And I shouldn't have
to remind you

737
00:27:46,693 --> 00:27:48,426
it's my duty to hand this over.

738
00:27:48,461 --> 00:27:51,195
Then back up a truck full of
documents and bury it,

739
00:27:51,231 --> 00:27:53,030
because your duty doesn't
include your guilt

740
00:27:53,066 --> 00:27:55,166
putting my company
out of business.

741
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,328
So you're telling me they
did not accept our settlement?

742
00:28:00,352 --> 00:28:03,286
Yes, and before you ask,
I did not overreact.

743
00:28:03,321 --> 00:28:06,389
They bought themselves a
so-called expert that's saying

744
00:28:06,424 --> 00:28:07,624
you should have known better

745
00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:09,125
than to change
that prescription.

746
00:28:09,161 --> 00:28:10,527
- What?
- Stan, trust me.

747
00:28:10,562 --> 00:28:13,096
It happens all the time.
Now the next step--

748
00:28:13,131 --> 00:28:14,497
Who do they have?

749
00:28:14,533 --> 00:28:16,466
Some joker named
Paul Baxter,

750
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:18,346
and I'll admit that his
credentials look good on paper,

751
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,981
but trust me,
when I get him on the stand--

752
00:28:20,005 --> 00:28:21,638
Louis, I know this man.

753
00:28:21,673 --> 00:28:23,406
His opinion is not for sale,

754
00:28:23,441 --> 00:28:26,753
and I will not let you
ruin his reputation,

755
00:28:26,754 --> 00:28:29,255
because if he's saying
I caused this--

756
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,690
No, Stan, he's not saying it.
They're pushing him to say it.

757
00:28:31,726 --> 00:28:32,726
And I just told you

758
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,526
they couldn't push him
to say anything.

759
00:28:34,562 --> 00:28:37,429
What if I misprescribed,
Louis?

760
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:42,334
What if I am truly responsible
for my own patient's breakdown?

761
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,403
And if a jury decides that,
so be it.

762
00:28:44,438 --> 00:28:45,549
But you're the one who
told me a thousand times

763
00:28:45,573 --> 00:28:48,340
it's not an exact science,
right?

764
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:51,143
Craig Boyd is unstable.
Could have had a bad day

765
00:28:51,178 --> 00:28:53,646
or a fight with his mother
or a thousand other things

766
00:28:53,681 --> 00:28:55,347
that could have caused this,

767
00:28:55,383 --> 00:28:57,683
but we are not going down
without a fight.

768
00:29:00,254 --> 00:29:02,121
Okay, Louis.

769
00:29:02,156 --> 00:29:04,390
Do what you must.
Put Dr. Baxter on the stand.

770
00:29:04,425 --> 00:29:06,392
Good, and I'm putting
Craig Boyd up there too.

771
00:29:06,427 --> 00:29:09,147
What?
Louis, you can't do that.

772
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:10,464
He's my patient.

773
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,398
Stan, if we don't get you
out of this,

774
00:29:11,434 --> 00:29:13,701
no one's gonna be your
patient.

775
00:29:13,736 --> 00:29:15,970
Louis,
let's say you're correct.

776
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:17,938
That he broke down
for another reason.

777
00:29:17,974 --> 00:29:18,906
What do you think will happen

778
00:29:18,941 --> 00:29:20,741
when you go after him
on the stand?

779
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:21,709
Hopefully, he'll have
another breakdown

780
00:29:21,744 --> 00:29:22,921
which will show that
the first one

781
00:29:22,945 --> 00:29:24,812
had nothing to do with
his medication.

782
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:26,747
Well, that is not something
I can hope for.

783
00:29:26,782 --> 00:29:30,818
Stan, I did what you asked
with his lawyer.

784
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,153
I wasn't myself.

785
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:35,356
But you can't ask me
to not do everything I can

786
00:29:35,391 --> 00:29:37,358
to get you out of this.
It's him or you.

787
00:29:37,393 --> 00:29:38,592
Then let it be him

788
00:29:38,628 --> 00:29:40,294
because if he were to hurt
himself or,

789
00:29:40,329 --> 00:29:42,796
God forbid, worse,
I could not live with that.

790
00:29:42,832 --> 00:29:46,967
- Stan--
- Louis, this is my final word.

791
00:29:47,003 --> 00:29:50,104
So if you insist
on going after Craig,

792
00:29:50,139 --> 00:29:52,473
I will find another lawyer.

793
00:29:59,618 --> 00:30:01,752
Harvey, whatever it is,
it'll have to wait.

794
00:30:01,787 --> 00:30:04,054
- I'm busy preparing.
- I know what you're preparing.

795
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:06,857
And I know instead of going
to the judge,

796
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:09,793
you could go to Scottie
with this.

797
00:30:15,935 --> 00:30:17,801
She came to you,
didn't she?

798
00:30:17,836 --> 00:30:19,670
Because she was in
on this thing.

799
00:30:19,705 --> 00:30:21,772
- I didn't say that.
- You didn't have to.

800
00:30:21,807 --> 00:30:23,285
The settlement says it
loud and clear.

801
00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:24,441
- Look--
- No.

802
00:30:24,476 --> 00:30:26,143
I've got proof
of serious fraud,

803
00:30:26,178 --> 00:30:27,422
and you're here to get me
to let them off the hook.

804
00:30:27,446 --> 00:30:28,723
I'm here to get you to let
her off the hook.

805
00:30:28,747 --> 00:30:29,613
And why should I do that?

806
00:30:29,648 --> 00:30:32,082
Because you used to
sleep with her?

807
00:30:32,117 --> 00:30:33,684
Because she did it for
the right reasons

808
00:30:33,719 --> 00:30:35,719
just like when
you buried evidence.

809
00:30:35,754 --> 00:30:37,487
You said you did it for
the right reasons,

810
00:30:37,523 --> 00:30:39,167
and by the way, you told me
you'd do it again.

811
00:30:39,191 --> 00:30:41,091
That was to save
an innocent woman's life.

812
00:30:41,126 --> 00:30:44,027
This is to save
innocent peoples' jobs.

813
00:30:44,063 --> 00:30:45,640
I'm not gonna let you do
this to Scottie.

814
00:30:45,664 --> 00:30:47,264
This is my case.

815
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:49,466
You told me you didn't want
anything to do with it,

816
00:30:49,501 --> 00:30:51,868
and now you want me to sell
my client down the river.

817
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,037
I'm not asking you to sell
anyone down the river.

818
00:30:54,073 --> 00:30:56,240
I'm asking you to have
her back.

819
00:30:56,275 --> 00:30:58,742
This isn't about me
having her back.

820
00:30:58,777 --> 00:31:01,345
It's about you having mine.

821
00:31:01,949 --> 00:31:04,003
And you didn't
when you told her about me,

822
00:31:04,004 --> 00:31:05,771
you didn't when I came to you
for help,

823
00:31:05,806 --> 00:31:08,841
and you don't have it
right now.

824
00:31:11,212 --> 00:31:13,612
Maybe I didn't have
your back,

825
00:31:13,647 --> 00:31:16,448
but on this one I can't.

826
00:31:16,484 --> 00:31:18,662
Guess I'm saying if you're not
willing to have her back,

827
00:31:18,686 --> 00:31:21,720
think of it as having mine.

828
00:31:28,729 --> 00:31:30,329
Donna,
can I talk to you a second?

829
00:31:30,364 --> 00:31:31,908
Does this have something
to do with Lipschitz?

830
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:34,399
Yeah.

831
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:36,435
I have an idea,
but it involves

832
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,814
going to his patient
behind his back

833
00:31:37,838 --> 00:31:39,349
and threatening to put him
on the stand.

834
00:31:39,373 --> 00:31:40,717
Why can't you just put him
on the stand?

835
00:31:40,741 --> 00:31:42,374
Because Lipschitz
won't let me,

836
00:31:42,409 --> 00:31:45,077
and if he found out
that I even met with him,

837
00:31:45,418 --> 00:31:47,646
could ruin our relationship.

838
00:31:48,128 --> 00:31:50,062
- Then don't do it.
- But if I don't, Donna,

839
00:31:50,097 --> 00:31:51,730
then he'll probably lose
his license.

840
00:31:51,765 --> 00:31:53,565
And as hard as
that is to accept,

841
00:31:53,601 --> 00:31:56,001
it's his choice.

842
00:31:56,036 --> 00:31:57,803
So I say if you really care
about him,

843
00:31:57,838 --> 00:32:03,475
you need to stop representing
him and start being his friend.

844
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,611
I'm not sure
if I can do that.

845
00:32:05,646 --> 00:32:09,414
I hope you can.

846
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,549
- Louis.
- Yeah.

847
00:32:10,584 --> 00:32:12,751
As long as we're talking
about mixing the personal

848
00:32:12,786 --> 00:32:15,387
with the professional,
there's...

849
00:32:15,422 --> 00:32:17,155
something that's
been on my mind,

850
00:32:17,191 --> 00:32:19,391
and I haven't told you
and it's time that I did.

851
00:32:19,426 --> 00:32:21,159
What is it?

852
00:32:21,195 --> 00:32:23,195
Thomas Kessler and I have
been seeing each other,

853
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:26,264
and I know he's a client--
- Say no more, Donna.

854
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,517
Thomas is a good man,
and as far as I'm concerned,

855
00:32:29,518 --> 00:32:31,095
if you two are okay
with seeing each other

856
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,897
while he's still a client,
then I'm okay with it too.

857
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:34,554
- Thanks, Louis.
- Of course, Donna.

858
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:36,356
I just have on question.

859
00:32:36,391 --> 00:32:38,791
Have you told Harvey yet?

860
00:32:38,827 --> 00:32:41,594
No, I haven't,

861
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,897
but I will.

862
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,107
I should've known.

863
00:32:54,142 --> 00:32:56,776
You did all this.
You went to him, didn't you?

864
00:32:56,811 --> 00:33:00,413
- Yes, I did.
- God damn it.

865
00:33:00,448 --> 00:33:02,248
I came to you to help me.

866
00:33:02,284 --> 00:33:04,957
You came to me because
I kick ass as an attorney.

867
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,324
And in case you didn't notice,

868
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,792
you wouldn't even be
in the position

869
00:33:07,828 --> 00:33:09,561
to make a decision
if it weren't for me.

870
00:33:09,596 --> 00:33:11,396
In case you didn't notice,

871
00:33:11,431 --> 00:33:13,465
I have already made
my decision,

872
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,677
because I don't give
a shit what Harvey says.

873
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,701
We're in the fourth quarter,
we're up by ten,

874
00:33:16,737 --> 00:33:18,181
and I am not taking
my foot off the gas.

875
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,804
What the hell
is wrong with you?

876
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,651
You have a chance to
let someone keep their life

877
00:33:21,675 --> 00:33:23,008
and still get a win.

878
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:25,510
- Is revenge that important?
- It's not revenge.

879
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:28,313
- It's protection.
- From what?

880
00:33:28,348 --> 00:33:30,515
She went after me in public.

881
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,317
- Tried to expose me as--
- As what?

882
00:33:32,352 --> 00:33:34,753
Exactly who you are?
Well, here's a thought.

883
00:33:34,788 --> 00:33:36,628
If you don't want
to be exposed at that,

884
00:33:36,629 --> 00:33:38,973
maybe try not being that
in the first place.

885
00:33:38,974 --> 00:33:40,673
I can't change who I was.

886
00:33:40,709 --> 00:33:43,810
No, but you can start turning
it around right now.

887
00:33:43,845 --> 00:33:46,613
And at the same time,
you'll have Harvey owe you

888
00:33:46,648 --> 00:33:47,714
and Scottie owe you.

889
00:33:47,749 --> 00:33:50,450
What good does it do
to have those people owe me

890
00:33:50,485 --> 00:33:52,452
if they're just gonna be
like you

891
00:33:52,487 --> 00:33:54,421
and not pay up
when the time comes?

892
00:33:54,456 --> 00:33:56,856
I am paid up.

893
00:33:56,892 --> 00:33:59,002
You just don't get
that because owing you

894
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,770
doesn't mean doing
whatever you say.

895
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:03,706
I am a senior partner and
I have done everything I can

896
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,808
to help you come out
a winner in this.

897
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,187
And if you can't see that,
that's on you.

898
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,744
So I'll just say
you're welcome

899
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,714
and leave it at that.

900
00:34:15,835 --> 00:34:17,669
Gretchen, not now.

901
00:34:17,704 --> 00:34:18,770
Yes, now.

902
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:21,830
Because you put in a request
for 50,000 documents

903
00:34:21,831 --> 00:34:23,015
to all be delivered tonight.

904
00:34:23,016 --> 00:34:24,349
I don't want to
talk about it.

905
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,084
Yes, you do or you
wouldn't have had

906
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:28,386
the request specifically take
priority over my case.

907
00:34:28,422 --> 00:34:30,321
- I didn't--
- Don't bullshit me.

908
00:34:30,357 --> 00:34:32,135
You did that because you don't
like what's going on

909
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,825
and you wanted me
to talk you out of it.

910
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,260
There is no
talking me out of it.

911
00:34:35,295 --> 00:34:38,130
Well, we'll just have to see
about that then.

912
00:34:38,131 --> 00:34:40,064
Because it doesn't take
a genius to guess

913
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,799
you don't need that many copies

914
00:34:41,835 --> 00:34:43,412
unless you're trying to hide
something in them.

915
00:34:43,436 --> 00:34:44,981
Okay, maybe I did want you
to talk me out of it,

916
00:34:45,005 --> 00:34:46,738
but it's too late now.
They're already gone.

917
00:34:46,773 --> 00:34:49,540
They may already be gone,
but it's never too late.

918
00:34:49,576 --> 00:34:52,677
- Gretchen--
- No, imagine it was me.

919
00:34:52,712 --> 00:34:56,581
Imagine you were letting me
think I killed my Carl.

920
00:34:56,616 --> 00:34:59,283
Would it still be
too late then?

921
00:35:04,657 --> 00:35:06,924
- Can I help you?
- Hi, I'm Louis Litt.

922
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,093
- I'm--
- I know who are you.

923
00:35:09,129 --> 00:35:10,339
You're the guy representing
Dr. Lipschitz,

924
00:35:10,363 --> 00:35:13,231
which means you can't see me
without my lawyer here.

925
00:35:13,266 --> 00:35:15,099
Except I'm not here
as his attorney.

926
00:35:15,135 --> 00:35:16,501
I'm here as one of his
patients.

927
00:35:16,536 --> 00:35:18,136
- What?
- Yeah.

928
00:35:18,171 --> 00:35:21,005
I've been seeing Stan
for a very long time,

929
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:22,440
which is why I know
how valuable

930
00:35:22,475 --> 00:35:24,142
having someone like him
in the world is

931
00:35:24,177 --> 00:35:26,044
and how much he's probably
helped you.

932
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,045
You don't know nothing
about me.

933
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,880
No, I don't.

934
00:35:28,915 --> 00:35:31,644
But I know about me
and the thing about me

935
00:35:31,645 --> 00:35:34,964
is I'd do anything to blame
others before I blame myself.

936
00:35:34,965 --> 00:35:36,932
And if you think
that's what I'm doing,

937
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:38,833
then you can go to hell--
- What I think

938
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:41,736
is you're protecting yourself,
but what you don't know is

939
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:43,283
Stanly Lipschitz
is protecting you too.

940
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,272
What are you talking about?

941
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,485
I could put you on
the stand right now

942
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:48,343
and I can break you.
Look at me.

943
00:35:48,378 --> 00:35:51,313
I can do it in a heartbeat,
but he won't let me do that

944
00:35:51,348 --> 00:35:53,114
because of what
it would do to you

945
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,951
even if it means losing
his ability to help others.

946
00:35:55,986 --> 00:35:58,186
Isn't that proof enough
that the world's a better place

947
00:35:58,221 --> 00:36:02,257
with Dr. Stanley Lipschitz
doing what he does best?

948
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:08,367
I lost everything.
I have no job.

949
00:36:08,402 --> 00:36:10,635
If I walk away from this,
what am I gonna do?

950
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:13,171
Two things. First, you meet
me in my office tomorrow.

951
00:36:13,207 --> 00:36:15,474
I represent
the top construction firms

952
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:19,378
in the country, and we will
find you another job.

953
00:36:19,413 --> 00:36:21,346
- And then?
- You call Dr. Lipschitz.

954
00:36:21,382 --> 00:36:23,048
You set up an appointment,

955
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:26,184
and you start talking
this through...

956
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:30,022
because you need him now
more than ever.

957
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:41,313
- Get the hell off my driveway.
- I get it.

958
00:36:41,348 --> 00:36:43,081
You hate me,
but I was doing my job.

959
00:36:43,116 --> 00:36:44,349
It wasn't personal.

960
00:36:44,384 --> 00:36:46,218
You accused me of
killing my wife.

961
00:36:46,253 --> 00:36:47,619
Felt pretty goddamn personal
to me,

962
00:36:47,654 --> 00:36:49,487
so tell me what the hell
you're doing here.

963
00:36:49,523 --> 00:36:52,357
There's a truckload of files
on the way to your lawyer.

964
00:36:52,392 --> 00:36:56,127
I was just gonna let them go
and--needle in a haystack,

965
00:36:56,163 --> 00:36:57,762
but I couldn't.

966
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,165
so I made a second copy
of one file,

967
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,933
and I'm here to give it to you.

968
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,035
Why are you giving it to me
and not my lawyer?

969
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:05,840
Because this is the one
that says

970
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:07,542
there was a problem
with our software.

971
00:37:07,577 --> 00:37:08,810
So you lied to my face.

972
00:37:08,845 --> 00:37:10,445
We didn't lie.
We didn't know.

973
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,246
- Bullshit.
- It's not bullshit.

974
00:37:12,282 --> 00:37:13,759
Antonio offered you that deal
when he honestly believed

975
00:37:13,783 --> 00:37:15,717
his company had nothing
to do with this.

976
00:37:15,752 --> 00:37:17,585
You're not here
to give me this.

977
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,253
You're here to ask me
to go easy on him.

978
00:37:19,289 --> 00:37:22,423
No, James.
I'm here because in my heart

979
00:37:22,459 --> 00:37:24,336
I know you had nothing to do
with your wife's death,

980
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,427
and I'm sorry
I ever said otherwise.

981
00:37:26,463 --> 00:37:28,362
What happened was
one in a million thing,

982
00:37:28,398 --> 00:37:29,709
and I also know
if this comes out,

983
00:37:29,733 --> 00:37:32,366
more people are going to die,
not less.

984
00:37:32,402 --> 00:37:34,302
I know you're a good man.

985
00:37:34,337 --> 00:37:36,838
Please don't put
an end to this company.

986
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:53,571
Scottie, please tell me
it all worked out.

987
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:54,872
It did.

988
00:37:54,908 --> 00:37:56,674
Samantha came to me
with a deal,

989
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,577
nothing comes out, we all
live to fight another day.

990
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:01,245
<i>Well, that's great news.</i>

991
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:03,781
Listen, if I came across
as judging you, I--

992
00:38:03,817 --> 00:38:07,218
You didn't.
You came through for me, so...

993
00:38:07,253 --> 00:38:09,187
thank you.

994
00:38:09,222 --> 00:38:11,622
But?

995
00:38:11,658 --> 00:38:13,925
Why did you do it?

996
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,427
Why did you help me?

997
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:18,696
There are a lot of things
that we're at odds

998
00:38:18,732 --> 00:38:22,200
with each other about,
Scottie, but...

999
00:38:22,235 --> 00:38:24,339
the one thing
we've always had in common

1000
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,707
is that we both care about him.

1001
00:38:27,943 --> 00:38:30,511
And you've always
protected him.

1002
00:38:31,881 --> 00:38:35,482
That means something.

1003
00:38:35,518 --> 00:38:37,151
I called to tell you that

1004
00:38:37,186 --> 00:38:39,286
I'm going to live up
to my agreement.

1005
00:38:39,321 --> 00:38:41,088
From now on,
I'll stay away from him.

1006
00:38:41,123 --> 00:38:42,523
I told you
that's not what I meant.

1007
00:38:42,558 --> 00:38:44,491
<i>I know,</i>
<i>but I'm going to anyway.</i>

1008
00:38:45,694 --> 00:38:51,265
And, Donna...I hope someday
he sees what everyone sees.

1009
00:39:03,112 --> 00:39:05,112
I'm guessing somebody
got a call from Craig.

1010
00:39:05,147 --> 00:39:06,747
I did, Louis.
Going to him

1011
00:39:06,782 --> 00:39:08,382
as a patient
instead of as my attorney

1012
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:10,284
was a wonderful idea.

1013
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:12,152
I can't thank you enough.

1014
00:39:12,188 --> 00:39:15,808
However, there is still one
thing we must discuss.

1015
00:39:15,908 --> 00:39:17,641
Yeah,
if this is about payment,

1016
00:39:17,677 --> 00:39:18,987
you can just reinstate my
weekend texting privileges

1017
00:39:19,011 --> 00:39:20,644
and we'll just call it even.

1018
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,080
You know that's not what
I was going to say.

1019
00:39:23,116 --> 00:39:24,849
You agreed that once
this was over,

1020
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:26,617
I would no longer be
your therapist.

1021
00:39:26,652 --> 00:39:29,019
<i>I am calling to discuss</i>
<i>our transition.</i>

1022
00:39:29,055 --> 00:39:30,988
No, I don't accept that.

1023
00:39:31,023 --> 00:39:32,523
Louis,
you know too much

1024
00:39:32,558 --> 00:39:34,792
for me to effectively continue
as your therapist.

1025
00:39:34,827 --> 00:39:37,661
Well, pardon my French, Stan,
but that is bullshit.

1026
00:39:37,697 --> 00:39:39,263
Our best breakthroughs
were made

1027
00:39:39,298 --> 00:39:41,098
by you sharing
your personal life with me.

1028
00:39:41,134 --> 00:39:43,367
And those were wonderful
sessions,

1029
00:39:43,403 --> 00:39:45,903
but, Louis, you agreed.
<i>- No, I don't care.</i>

1030
00:39:45,938 --> 00:39:47,571
- Louis.
- Stan,

1031
00:39:47,607 --> 00:39:48,973
Even three years ago,

1032
00:39:49,008 --> 00:39:51,061
I would have gone behind
your back,

1033
00:39:51,062 --> 00:39:52,695
threatened to put Craig
on the stand,

1034
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:55,898
and God knows what he might
have done to himself,

1035
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:59,335
<i>but because of you</i>
<i>I went to him with compassion.</i>

1036
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:03,238
If that isn't proof showing me
your human side is effective,

1037
00:40:03,274 --> 00:40:05,174
Stan, I don't know what is.

1038
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,914
Weekend texting
will never return,

1039
00:40:12,825 --> 00:40:16,627
but I can try to answer
your e-mails

1040
00:40:16,662 --> 00:40:19,630
in a more timely fashion.

1041
00:40:19,665 --> 00:40:23,767
- Thank you, Stan.
- No, Louis, thank you.

1042
00:40:28,941 --> 00:40:30,474
Well?

1043
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,787
He asked for twice the money
so he can set up

1044
00:40:31,811 --> 00:40:33,377
a foundation
in his wife's name,

1045
00:40:33,412 --> 00:40:35,546
but he agreed to keep
the settlement sealed.

1046
00:40:35,581 --> 00:40:37,648
What about Tony?
He figure out what you did?

1047
00:40:37,683 --> 00:40:39,950
- He did.
- What'd you tell him?

1048
00:40:39,986 --> 00:40:41,797
What I should have told him
in the first place.

1049
00:40:41,821 --> 00:40:45,389
That what he asked wasn't right
by me, James, or anyone else,

1050
00:40:45,424 --> 00:40:47,925
and if you ever ask me to do
anything like it again,

1051
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,661
he can find himself
another lawyer.

1052
00:40:50,696 --> 00:40:52,596
He's lucky to have you.

1053
00:40:52,632 --> 00:40:54,431
And I'm lucky to have you.

1054
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:57,401
- Are you hitting on me?
- No,

1055
00:40:57,436 --> 00:41:00,337
but I am inviting you
to dinner tomorrow night.

1056
00:41:00,373 --> 00:41:02,273
I could invite
my father-in-law too.

1057
00:41:02,308 --> 00:41:03,574
He's a widower.

1058
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:06,143
Not bad-looking...
if you ask him.

1059
00:41:06,178 --> 00:41:08,245
And I will tell you
what I told Carl.

1060
00:41:08,281 --> 00:41:12,616
After he's gone,
there won't be any other men.

1061
00:41:12,652 --> 00:41:14,385
He didn't believe me either.

1062
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,155
See you tomorrow night.
Invite Pops.

1063
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,491
We'll see what happens.

1064
00:41:27,122 --> 00:41:29,055
Hey.

1065
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,490
Hey.

1066
00:41:30,525 --> 00:41:31,891
I just wanted you to know--

1067
00:41:31,926 --> 00:41:34,026
Scottie called to thank me,
Harvey.

1068
00:41:34,062 --> 00:41:36,129
That's funny.
She just called me.

1069
00:41:36,164 --> 00:41:38,464
Well, I guess she's grateful
to both of us.

1070
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,700
I guess so.

1071
00:41:40,735 --> 00:41:43,669
Um...

1072
00:41:43,705 --> 00:41:46,639
did she say something
to you about...

1073
00:41:46,674 --> 00:41:48,775
About what?

1074
00:41:50,812 --> 00:41:52,779
- Oh, perfect timing.
- Thomas.

1075
00:41:52,814 --> 00:41:54,380
I thought we were meeting
downstairs.

1076
00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:55,381
Well, I got here
a little early.

1077
00:41:55,417 --> 00:41:56,682
I thought I'd come meet you.

1078
00:41:56,718 --> 00:41:59,819
- Harvey, this is Thomas--
- Kessler, we've met.

1079
00:41:59,854 --> 00:42:01,387
- Nice to see you again.
- You too.

1080
00:42:01,423 --> 00:42:03,122
Louis always spoke
very highly of you.

1081
00:42:03,158 --> 00:42:04,891
You too.

1082
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,261
- Well, shall we?
- Of course.

1083
00:42:10,265 --> 00:42:13,366
- Good night, Harvey.
- Good night.

1084
00:42:21,096 --> 00:42:23,029
You look lost.

1085
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,034
I was just...

1086
00:42:30,605 --> 00:42:34,274
I'm sorry I didn't
say yes sooner.

1087
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:36,342
She pushed a button.

1088
00:42:36,378 --> 00:42:39,612
I let my competitive nature
get the better of me.

1089
00:42:39,648 --> 00:42:42,448
- She does that.
- She sure does.

1090
00:42:44,452 --> 00:42:46,619
Hey, I was gonna go to
my office and get a drink,

1091
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,588
but now I'm thinking
I want to go out.

1092
00:42:48,623 --> 00:42:51,557
- You care to join me?
- Why not?

1093
00:42:51,593 --> 00:42:52,725
But you're buying,

1094
00:42:52,761 --> 00:42:55,528
'cause after all,
I had your back.

1095
00:42:55,563 --> 00:42:57,530
I am never gonna hear the end
of this, am I?

1096
00:42:57,565 --> 00:43:00,033
No, sir, you are not.

1097
00:43:00,068 --> 00:43:04,070
You got anymore ex-girlfriend
lawyers I should know about?

1098
00:43:04,105 --> 00:43:07,006
I'll send you a list.
