<i>Previously, on "Suits..."</i>

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,709
- You can't put the needs
of our child

3
00:00:04,015 --> 00:00:05,066
above your own.

4
00:00:05,067 --> 00:00:06,244
- I'm not saying that.
- Then what are you saying?

5
00:00:06,268 --> 00:00:08,802
Because I may not be
a mother yet,

6
00:00:08,837 --> 00:00:10,404
but I know that's what
parenthood means.

7
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:11,716
- You wanna take me on,
you go for it.

8
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,851
'Cause I didn't get where I am

9
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,641
by letting people like you
push me around.

10
00:00:14,677 --> 00:00:16,109
- David Fox wants a fight,

11
00:00:16,145 --> 00:00:17,244
and I'm gonna give him one.

12
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,245
- Are you threatening my job?

13
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,147
- I like you, always have.

14
00:00:20,182 --> 00:00:22,716
But if you don't get yourself
on the right of this thing

15
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:24,496
you're never gonna go further
than you are right now.

16
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,387
- I care about the kids this
charity is supposed to serve.

17
00:00:27,423 --> 00:00:29,790
But you wouldn't know that
because I just don't...

18
00:00:29,825 --> 00:00:30,791
trust...
- People.

19
00:00:30,826 --> 00:00:32,392
- Are you saying
you took another job?

20
00:00:32,428 --> 00:00:34,928
- No, I'm saying I got someone
else to take another job.

21
00:00:34,963 --> 00:00:36,007
- You still didn't do
what I asked.

22
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:37,208
- I signed a client
that's gonna be worth

23
00:00:37,232 --> 00:00:38,999
a huge amount
to this firm.

24
00:00:39,034 --> 00:00:41,068
I'm a hell of a goddamn lawyer.

25
00:00:41,103 --> 00:00:43,181
- You start paying those people
what they're worth...

26
00:00:43,205 --> 00:00:44,404
- And?

27
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,351
- You get free legal services
from Harvey Specter himself

28
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:47,674
for the next year.

29
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,853
You didn't notice that one
of your star attorneys

30
00:00:48,877 --> 00:00:50,077
was thinking about leaving.

31
00:00:50,112 --> 00:00:51,344
And now, thanks to me,

32
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,579
he's gonna stay.

33
00:00:52,614 --> 00:00:55,048
- You're talking about Alex.
- Sometimes, you need

34
00:00:55,084 --> 00:00:58,685
to let us do what we do
the way we do it.

35
00:01:02,357 --> 00:01:04,591
- Hello, stranger...
seems the only thing

36
00:01:04,626 --> 00:01:05,692
I see of you lately

37
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:07,260
is your name on the wall.

38
00:01:07,296 --> 00:01:08,840
- That's because I've been
out of town a few days,

39
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,763
and I need your help.

40
00:01:09,798 --> 00:01:10,831
- Give it to me.

41
00:01:10,866 --> 00:01:12,610
- I've got a legal situation,
and it's personal.

42
00:01:12,634 --> 00:01:13,467
- Which means you need me

43
00:01:13,502 --> 00:01:15,736
to send one of ours your way.

44
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:17,437
- I was thinking Alex Williams.

45
00:01:17,473 --> 00:01:18,905
<i>- Would you mind if I ask</i>

46
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:19,951
why you didn't
just call him yourself?

47
00:01:19,975 --> 00:01:21,808
<i>- I was thinking about</i>

48
00:01:21,844 --> 00:01:23,188
a conversation we had
a few weeks ago.

49
00:01:23,212 --> 00:01:26,646
You helped me see some things
about fostering firm harmony.

50
00:01:26,682 --> 00:01:27,759
- And if you called him
directly,

51
00:01:27,783 --> 00:01:29,561
you wouldn't have had a chance
to tell me that.

52
00:01:29,585 --> 00:01:30,617
- Right again, Red.

53
00:01:30,652 --> 00:01:32,352
- I'm guessing
firm harmony is also why

54
00:01:32,387 --> 00:01:33,854
you want Alex and not Samantha.

55
00:01:33,889 --> 00:01:35,021
<i>- A little bit of that,</i>

56
00:01:35,057 --> 00:01:36,201
and a little
of the nature of the case.

57
00:01:36,225 --> 00:01:39,760
<i>- Then why don't you tell me</i>
<i>where you are,</i>

58
00:01:39,795 --> 00:01:42,162
what Alex needs to bring,
and I will make sure

59
00:01:42,197 --> 00:01:44,131
<i>that he is on his way.</i>

60
00:01:48,637 --> 00:01:50,003
- Harvey Specter.

61
00:01:51,173 --> 00:01:52,739
- David Fox.

62
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:54,374
To what do I owe the--

63
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:56,042
what's the opposite
of pleasure?

64
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:58,044
- I'm here 'cause of this.
It's a deal.

65
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,012
It just needs
a little taking care of.

66
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:00,714
- Well, in that case,

67
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:02,160
just go ahead
and throw it in the trash,

68
00:02:02,184 --> 00:02:04,718
'cause I don't work for you
and I'm never going to.

69
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:06,686
- Uh, I'm not asking.
I'm assigning.

70
00:02:06,722 --> 00:02:07,821
This is part of our deal.

71
00:02:07,856 --> 00:02:10,757
- I don't have any deal
with you.

72
00:02:10,793 --> 00:02:12,492
- She didn't tell you, did she?

73
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,496
- Who didn't tell me what?

74
00:02:16,532 --> 00:02:17,597
- Donna.

75
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:20,233
We made a deal
where you're my lawyer.

76
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:21,401
I'm holding you both to it.

77
00:02:21,436 --> 00:02:24,104
And if you got a problem
with that...

78
00:02:25,374 --> 00:02:26,873
Take it up with her.

79
00:02:33,682 --> 00:02:34,726
- Donna.
What can I do for you?

80
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,860
- You can get your ass
into the limo

81
00:02:35,884 --> 00:02:37,951
that's waiting for you
downstairs.

82
00:02:37,986 --> 00:02:40,854
- I didn't call a limo.
- I know you didn't.

83
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:41,755
Robert Zane did.

84
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,456
- And where exactly
is Robert sending me?

85
00:02:43,492 --> 00:02:44,791
- Upstate New York.

86
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:45,870
He has some business
he needs help with.

87
00:02:45,894 --> 00:02:48,995
So whatever needs fixing,
fix it fast.

88
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:50,693
- Did you go through
my underwear drawer?

89
00:02:50,717 --> 00:02:52,550
- As fun as that would have
made my morning,

90
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:54,216
no, Alex, I didn't.

91
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:56,078
I bought a bag
with exactly everything

92
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,323
you'll need
for as long as you're gone.

93
00:02:57,347 --> 00:02:58,212
- And how could you
possibly know

94
00:02:58,248 --> 00:02:59,572
that's everything I'll need?

95
00:02:59,573 --> 00:03:01,321
- Because Robert needed me to.

96
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:04,896
And because I'm Donna.

97
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:06,798
Limo's not gonna wait
all day, Alex.

98
00:03:09,836 --> 00:03:12,421
Morning, Harvey.
What can I do for you?

99
00:03:12,422 --> 00:03:14,620
- You can tell me
David Fox isn't my client.

100
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:17,622
- I'm sorry, I can't do that,
because he is.

101
00:03:17,657 --> 00:03:19,524
For a year.
Free of charge.

102
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:20,559
- How is that possible?

103
00:03:20,593 --> 00:03:22,260
- It's possible
because you empowered me

104
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:23,328
to negotiate with him,

105
00:03:23,363 --> 00:03:24,573
and that's what it took
to get it done.

106
00:03:24,597 --> 00:03:26,564
- And when were you
gonna tell me

107
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,066
about this brilliant idea
of yours?

108
00:03:28,101 --> 00:03:29,300
- I already did tell you

109
00:03:29,336 --> 00:03:30,579
when I added him
to your updated client roster.

110
00:03:30,603 --> 00:03:31,714
- You know damn well
I don't read

111
00:03:31,738 --> 00:03:34,539
my updated client roster.

112
00:03:34,574 --> 00:03:35,640
- Okay.
You got me.

113
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:36,886
I just wanted to see
the look on your face

114
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,210
when he came to you
and you realized

115
00:03:39,245 --> 00:03:40,178
you didn't have a choice.

116
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:42,046
And there it is.

117
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:44,215
- You think this is funny?
- No, Harvey.

118
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,316
I don't.

119
00:03:45,352 --> 00:03:46,495
And the real reason
I didn't tell you

120
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,199
is because I knew
you'd react like a child.

121
00:03:48,524 --> 00:03:50,110
But I made a deal
that you gave me

122
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:51,582
the authority to make
because you knew

123
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,019
you couldn't come to one
yourself,

124
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,362
so whatever it is
you're feeling,

125
00:03:54,363 --> 00:03:56,694
suck it up,
take one for the team,

126
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,762
and get this thing done.

00:04:39,703 --> 00:04:41,503
but I can't have sex with you
right now.

I just ate an onion bagel.

Louis.

142
00:04:44,642 --> 00:04:45,819
- Well, then, why'd you call
on the sex phone?

143
00:04:45,843 --> 00:04:47,187

and...

you hit the bull's-eye.

Yes, they can.

We need to tell my--

156
00:05:14,472 --> 00:05:17,973
- Louis... I know you're gonna
want to tell everyone,

157
00:05:18,008 --> 00:05:20,609
but, before you do,
I want you to promise

158

that we'll keep this between
the two of us for a while.

159
00:05:22,813 --> 00:05:24,313

not tell anyone?

160
00:05:24,348 --> 00:05:25,747
<i>- Yeah, just for a while.</i>

161
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,027

Oh. Okay.

164
00:05:34,558 --> 00:05:36,091
It was just a billing question.

00:05:45,035 --> 00:05:47,102

00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:56,812
- Sheila's pregnant, isn't she?

174
00:05:56,847 --> 00:05:57,958
- Oh, shit,
how could you know that?

175
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,982
- Two minutes ago,
you were on your sex phone.

176
00:06:00,017 --> 00:06:02,684
Then you started dancing
up and down like "Footloose,"

177
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,219
pointing
to your nether regions.

178
00:06:04,255 --> 00:06:05,187
What else could it be?

179
00:06:05,222 --> 00:06:06,588
- Nothing else.

180
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,590
Gretchen.

181
00:06:10,561 --> 00:06:11,527
I'm gonna have a baby.

182
00:06:11,562 --> 00:06:14,763
- I can't believe
I'm saying this, Louis.

183
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:16,298
You're gonna be
a world-class father.

184
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,733
- That I am.

185
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:18,979
And I intend to be a part
of every moment,

186
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,580
which is why I need you
to look into what it takes

187
00:06:20,604 --> 00:06:21,648
to get certified as a midwife.

188
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,872
- If you think I'm gonna
be midwife to your baby,

189
00:06:23,908 --> 00:06:25,374
you got a whole
nother thing coming.

190
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:26,542
- No, not for you, for me.

191
00:06:26,577 --> 00:06:27,577
- And I'm out.
- What?

192
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:28,844
You think I couldn't do it?

193
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,713
- I know you couldn't.
- Well, damn it, Gretchen.

194
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:33,382
- Do you want to be
a wet nurse too?

195
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:34,628
- You know what?
I would if I could.

196
00:06:34,652 --> 00:06:36,563
And you just said
that I would be a great father.

197
00:06:36,587 --> 00:06:37,764
So are you gonna help me
with this or not?

198
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:39,655
- All right, Louis.
I'll look into it.

199
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,857
But it's like I said before.

200
00:06:41,892 --> 00:06:44,860
You're gonna be a great father.

201
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:48,565
- Okay, David.

202
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:50,666
What exactly is it
that you want?

203
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,646
Because you certainly don't
need me to hold your hand

204
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,769
while you buy a building.

205
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:55,971
- I do if that building's owner
is my biggest rival.

206
00:06:56,006 --> 00:06:58,440
- And because that owner knows
what an asshole you are,

207
00:06:58,475 --> 00:06:59,819
you need to make sure
he doesn't know

208
00:06:59,843 --> 00:07:01,343
you're the one
doing the buying.

209
00:07:01,378 --> 00:07:03,645
- See, this is why
I'm paying you the big bucks.

210
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:05,447
Oh, wait,
I'm not paying you anything.

211
00:07:05,482 --> 00:07:07,583
- Just so we're clear,
you get one of those.

212
00:07:07,618 --> 00:07:09,785
Because I may
have to represent you,

213
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,621
but I don't have to tolerate
your mouth.

214
00:07:12,656 --> 00:07:14,423
- And just so we're clear,

215
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,525
this guy's a douche,
not an idiot.

216
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,637
He's gonna be looking
for me to try to buy

217
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:19,695
that building,
so I need you to be smart.

218
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,608
- And that's the second time
you've brought this up.

219
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:23,365
Which makes me wonder
if there's something

220
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,962
going on here,
because hiding a buyer

221
00:07:25,963 --> 00:07:27,839
isn't illegal,
but it sure as hell can be.

222
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,707
- The only thing going on here
is that John Billows has

223
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:35,145
a piece of candy
and I want to take it from him.

224
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,214
One other thing.

225
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,616
This is my business.

226
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:41,651
So you take this on,
you get it done,

227
00:07:41,687 --> 00:07:43,787
or you don't take it on at all.

228
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:56,566
- Robert.
Good to see you.

229
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:59,603
- Thanks for coming, Alex.
How was the drive?

230
00:07:59,638 --> 00:08:03,406
- Scenic. Let me guess.
The owner's our client.

231
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,675
- The owner's me.

232
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:07,811
- I gotta tell you, Robert,
making wine's

233
00:08:07,846 --> 00:08:09,513
not exactly the hobby
I pictured for you.

234
00:08:09,548 --> 00:08:11,515
- It's not a hobby,
it's an investment.

235
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,317
And right now,
it's netting less than zero.

236
00:08:14,353 --> 00:08:16,019
- What can I do to help?

237
00:08:16,054 --> 00:08:17,832
- Why don't we first start
with a little tour?

238
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:24,305
- Samantha, can I talk to you
for a second?

239
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:26,096
- Sure, what's on your mind?

240
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:29,466
- You and Alex
and Robert and Harvey...

241
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:31,468
Harvey's got a case
that he doesn't want,

242
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:32,814
but there's nothing that says
that he can't

243
00:08:32,838 --> 00:08:34,437
get a little outside help
on it.

244
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:35,438
- Don't tell me you're trying
to give me a leg up

245
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:37,407
with Harvey,
because you wouldn't do that

246
00:08:37,442 --> 00:08:38,642
and I don't need it.

247
00:08:38,677 --> 00:08:40,076
- You're right.
I wouldn't.

248
00:08:40,112 --> 00:08:41,478
But sooner or later,
it's gonna be

249
00:08:41,513 --> 00:08:43,413
either you or Alex
who go up on that wall next,

250
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:44,626
and no matter who
goes up there first,

251
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,483
the other team isn't gonna
be happy about it.

252
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:48,118
But the more we're bonded
as a family

253
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,264
before that happens,
the more likely

254
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:52,956
we'll stay a family
after it does.

255
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,035
- Then I just have
one question.

256
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:54,958
When you said
Harvey doesn't want

257
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,827
to take the case
but he has to...

258
00:08:56,862 --> 00:08:58,028
- I did.
- Why?

259
00:08:58,063 --> 00:08:59,407
- Because I struck a deal
with David Fox,

260
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:01,164
and Harvey can't stand him.

261
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,500
- Can you?
- Not particularly.

262
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:04,679
- Then why don't you
get me up to speed

263
00:09:04,703 --> 00:09:08,071
before I go pay a visit
to this David Fox.

264
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,282
- Well?

265
00:09:19,318 --> 00:09:20,895
- I'm more of a craft brew--
- Oh, save the bullshit.

266
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:24,921
I know. It tastes like ass.
That's my problem.

267
00:09:24,957 --> 00:09:26,134
- So you want me
to fire your winemaker?

268
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:27,435
- No, I want you
to go after the son of a bitch

269
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:29,003
who didn't deliver the barrels
that I paid for.

270
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:33,230
Because I had to let my wine
stay in these vats,

271
00:09:33,265 --> 00:09:35,899
and it turned into that vinegar
you're now holding.

272
00:09:35,934 --> 00:09:37,245
- And no one's interested
in buying vinegar.

273
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:39,769
- I lost my entire harvest!

274
00:09:39,805 --> 00:09:41,338
- Shit.

275
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,239
What did the guy say

276
00:09:42,274 --> 00:09:44,407
when you called
about the barrels?

277
00:09:44,443 --> 00:09:46,109
- That they'd be here tomorrow.

278
00:09:46,144 --> 00:09:47,477
And tomorrow. And tomorrow.

279
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:50,547
And meanwhile, all my neighbors
got their barrels just fine.

280
00:09:50,582 --> 00:09:53,383
Which makes me think
there's more going on here

281
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:54,651
than it looks like.

282
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:56,273
- You think this is about race?

283
00:09:56,297 --> 00:09:58,866
- I think, between the looks
I got at the bank

284
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:00,404
and the cold shoulder
I got at the market

285
00:10:00,405 --> 00:10:01,069
and now this...

286
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:01,834
- You've seen this movie
before.

287
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,036
- Different cast,

288
00:10:03,071 --> 00:10:03,970
different location,

289
00:10:04,005 --> 00:10:05,471
but the same damn script.

290
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:07,138
- Robert,
if that's what's going on here,

291
00:10:07,162 --> 00:10:09,298
I'm not sure a lawsuit is gonna
get these guys to back off.

292
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:11,700
- Look, I'm not saying
they're wearing white robes.

293
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:12,744
I'm saying
they're trying to keep me

294
00:10:12,768 --> 00:10:14,935
out of the country club.

295
00:10:13,506 --> 00:10:14,572
- What do you want to do?

296
00:10:14,608 --> 00:10:16,574
- I want to send a message

297
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,787
that if they try this shit
again,

298
00:10:17,811 --> 00:10:19,577
there's not gonna be
a country club.

299
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:27,885
- The great Harvey Specter
walking through my door.

300
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:28,961
Now I know I'm a big deal.

301
00:10:28,989 --> 00:10:29,954
- Not as big as the deal

302
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,423
I'm about to offer you,
Mr. Billows.

303
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,225
- Oh, I like you already.

304
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:35,738
- Then you're really gonna love
my client.

305
00:10:35,762 --> 00:10:36,728
Santana Developers.

306
00:10:36,763 --> 00:10:37,940
They're an up-and-coming
real estate firm

307
00:10:37,964 --> 00:10:39,442
from the southwest,
and, fortunately for you,

308
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:43,067
they've taken an interest
in your redevelopment project

309
00:10:43,103 --> 00:10:43,868
on Liberty Avenue.

310
00:10:43,903 --> 00:10:45,470
- Have they, now?

311
00:10:45,505 --> 00:10:47,183
Well, that's a shame,
'cause it's not for sale.

312
00:10:47,207 --> 00:10:50,341
And there's no southwest firm
that I've never heard of.

313
00:10:50,377 --> 00:10:52,644
- All right. You got me.

314
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:56,147
My client's associated closely
with the government of Dubai.

315
00:10:56,182 --> 00:10:58,316
A fact
they'd rather not announce,

316
00:10:58,351 --> 00:11:02,620
and, in exchange
for that secrecy,

317
00:11:02,656 --> 00:11:04,989
they're willing
to offer you this.

318
00:11:09,262 --> 00:11:10,302
- Thank you for your time.

319
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,598
- John, that's 25%
over market value.

320
00:11:13,633 --> 00:11:14,633
All cash.

321
00:11:14,668 --> 00:11:17,068
- And I told you,
I'm not selling.

322
00:11:17,103 --> 00:11:20,071
Least of all to David Fox.

323
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:21,806
All right, John, look--

324
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:22,918
All right, look,
I'll give you credit.

325
00:11:22,942 --> 00:11:24,876
I mean, you do live up
to your reputation.

326
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:25,945
'Cause a fallback straw man

327
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:27,519
is something
even I never thought of.

328
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,798
- And if you really knew
my reputation,

329
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:32,590
you'd know a straw man
is just my first move.

330
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:33,736
You don't want to see
what I'm gonna

331
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,126
come at you with next.

332
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,060
- Well, I believe you'll try

333
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,363
to cut off my financing.

334
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,965
But my partners are in China.

335
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:44,102
And I've been in bed with them
for ten years.

336
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:48,072
They trust me implicitly.

337
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,674
Good day, Mr. Specter.

338
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,277
My regards to David Fox.

339
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:02,451
Louis, I can't believe

340
00:12:02,452 --> 00:12:04,428
you got us a reservation here
so quickly.

341
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:07,664
- Sheila, you're gonna be
the mother of my son.

342
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:09,432
I'm getting you in
wherever you want to go.

343
00:12:09,468 --> 00:12:12,002
- Son?
- Or daughter.

344
00:12:12,037 --> 00:12:13,247
- Well, here's to watching
either one of them

345
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:18,141
take ballet lessons and tap
and learn to twirl the baton.

346
00:12:18,176 --> 00:12:19,320
- Oh, my God,
I get to teach him the baton.

347
00:12:19,344 --> 00:12:21,778
I can't wait.
It's why I want to have a boy.

348
00:12:21,813 --> 00:12:24,147
- And I can't wait because
we're gonna be a family.

349
00:12:24,182 --> 00:12:25,982
And we're gonna
do everything together.

350
00:12:26,018 --> 00:12:28,084
We're gonna get ready
in the morning together.

351
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,397
We're gonna go
on vacations together.

352
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:30,665
- We're gonna get to visit him
at Camp Brucha

353
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:31,799
and see him come running out
in his little--

354
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:35,592
- Wait a second.
Camp Brucha?

355
00:12:35,627 --> 00:12:37,694
- No, Sheila, I know I told you
that the kids there

356
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:38,661
burned all my underwear,

357
00:12:38,697 --> 00:12:39,774
but I'm telling you,
it made me stronger.

358
00:12:39,798 --> 00:12:41,409
- Louis, your underwear
isn't what I'm talking about.

359
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:45,568
I meant
Brucha is a Jewish camp.

360
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:46,981
- Yeah, so what?
- So it never occurred to me

361
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:49,172
that you'd want
to raise our child Jewish.

362
00:12:49,207 --> 00:12:50,540
- Of course I do.

363
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:52,042
I thought
it went without saying.

364
00:12:52,077 --> 00:12:53,488
- Just like I thought
it went without saying

365
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:54,622
that we wouldn't
raise them anything.

366
00:12:54,646 --> 00:12:58,348
- Why would you think that?
- Okay, Louis.

367
00:12:58,383 --> 00:12:59,794
How would your parents feel
if we said

368
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:03,153
we were gonna raise
our child Catholic?

369
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:03,887
Exactly.

370
00:13:03,922 --> 00:13:05,099
That's how my parents
would feel

371
00:13:05,123 --> 00:13:07,524
if we raised our child Jewish.

372
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:09,726
- Yeah, but it's different.
- Not to me, it isn't.

373
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:11,761
- Sheila--
- Louis, please.

374
00:13:11,797 --> 00:13:13,897
This is supposed to be
a celebration.

375
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:16,566
Can't you just let it go?

376
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:18,034
- Of course, Sheila.

377
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,637
Consider it gone.

378
00:13:21,673 --> 00:13:23,106
- Miles Newton.

379
00:13:25,377 --> 00:13:26,509
- Yes?

380
00:13:26,545 --> 00:13:27,444
- My name is Alex Williams.

381
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:30,080
I represent Robert Zane.

382
00:13:30,115 --> 00:13:32,048
- Represent?
- That's right.

383
00:13:32,084 --> 00:13:34,384
He's suing you
for breach of contract.

384
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:35,285
- This is ridiculous.

385
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,597
I told him
it was a clerical error.

386
00:13:36,621 --> 00:13:37,832
- And that error cost him
his yield for the season.

387
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:39,100
- Look, I also told him
that I'll comp him

388
00:13:39,124 --> 00:13:42,959
all the barrels that he needs
next year to make up for it.

389
00:13:42,994 --> 00:13:44,038
- There may not be a next year
because you

390
00:13:44,062 --> 00:13:45,406
cheated my client out of money,
and now

391
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,008
you're gonna pay him back,
plus his lost revenue,

392
00:13:47,032 --> 00:13:48,276
and any other damages
I can hang on you.

393
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,966
- If I cheated him,
then why would I give

394
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:54,671
the new guy in town,
your guy, a cut-rate deal?

395
00:13:54,706 --> 00:13:55,638
- What are you talking about?

396
00:13:55,674 --> 00:13:56,884
- My other clients
paid 5% more.

397
00:13:56,908 --> 00:14:00,310
Your client was the one
who actually got a break.

398
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:01,511
A 30% discount.

399
00:14:01,546 --> 00:14:03,324
- And did the other vintners
know you were doing that?

400
00:14:03,348 --> 00:14:06,316
- We're a community up here,
Mr. Williams.

401
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:07,550
We protect our own.

402
00:14:07,586 --> 00:14:10,553
So they gave the new guy
a break,

403
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:11,855
and they took the hit,

404
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,190
so you want to slap me
with a lawsuit?

405
00:14:14,226 --> 00:14:18,595
Go ahead,
and we will just see who wins.

406
00:14:23,768 --> 00:14:25,513
- Look at you sweating it out
in the law library

407
00:14:25,537 --> 00:14:26,836
like a first-year.

408
00:14:26,872 --> 00:14:28,638
I didn't know you could read.

409
00:14:28,673 --> 00:14:29,606
- I'm just looking
at the pictures.

410
00:14:29,641 --> 00:14:31,041
- Then why don't you
let me help you

411
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:33,343
figure out
how to get that building.

412
00:14:33,378 --> 00:14:34,277
- Excuse me?

413
00:14:34,312 --> 00:14:35,245
- Donna thought you could use

414
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,424
some backup
dealing with David Fox.

415
00:14:36,448 --> 00:14:39,816
- Donna did, or you did?
- What does that mean?

416
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:41,751
- It means
you want to impress me

417
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:42,719
so when the time comes,
I'll vote for you.

418
00:14:42,754 --> 00:14:43,720
Well,
let me tell you something,

419
00:14:43,755 --> 00:14:45,255
that's never gonna happen.

420
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,256
- I know that.

421
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,768
And I'm here
because I just might have

422
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:50,093
a solution to your Fox problem.

423
00:14:50,128 --> 00:14:51,839
So you can either trust me
or you can figure out

424
00:14:51,863 --> 00:14:53,429
how to get out of this
yourself.

425
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:54,531
But for the record,

426
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:57,100
not everything I do
comes with a price tag.

427
00:14:57,135 --> 00:14:59,302
- This was Donna's idea?

428
00:14:59,337 --> 00:15:00,637
- Yeah, it was.

429
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:01,716
- Well, then,
why don't you sit down,

430
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,540
and I'll bring you up to speed.

431
00:15:03,575 --> 00:15:04,440
- I have a better idea.

432
00:15:04,476 --> 00:15:06,910
Why don't I sit down
and tell you

433
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:09,612
how we're gonna get
that building.

434
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:11,881
- How did it go?

435
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:13,983
- Exactly as planned.

436
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:16,553
- In that case, why don't we
have a drink to celebrate,

437
00:15:16,588 --> 00:15:18,488
and then we'll take care
of everything tomorrow.

438
00:15:18,523 --> 00:15:20,034
- As long as you have
a beer or some scotch,

439
00:15:20,058 --> 00:15:22,036
because I'm not drinking
any more of that vinegar shit.

440
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,227
Don't worry.

441
00:15:24,262 --> 00:15:25,762
Neither am I.

442
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:30,867
- Robert, I gotta ask.

443
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:34,304
You're a scotch guy.
You're a lawyer.

444
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:37,106
Why come up here
to buy a vineyard?

445
00:15:37,142 --> 00:15:39,943
- My sister.

446
00:15:39,978 --> 00:15:42,111
She died years ago.

447
00:15:42,147 --> 00:15:43,357
We used to drink wine together,

448
00:15:43,381 --> 00:15:47,317
and we didn't know shit
about vintage or tannins.

449
00:15:47,352 --> 00:15:49,519
We just knew what we liked.

450
00:15:49,554 --> 00:15:51,721
And when I drink wine,
I think about her.

451
00:15:51,756 --> 00:15:53,523
- I didn't know
you had a sister.

452
00:15:53,558 --> 00:15:55,525
- Well, now you do.

453
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,761
I worked a case with Rachel
last year,

454
00:15:58,797 --> 00:16:00,330
got me thinking about her
even more.

455
00:16:00,365 --> 00:16:01,898
And I realized...

456
00:16:03,435 --> 00:16:05,535
I like thinking about her
even more.

457
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,515
- Then here's to making sure
you're thinking of her

458
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:09,205
till you're old and gray.

459
00:16:09,241 --> 00:16:11,774
- Got that right.

460
00:16:15,714 --> 00:16:18,481
- Oh, thanks for making time
for me, Esther.

461
00:16:18,516 --> 00:16:19,282
I really appreciate it.

462
00:16:19,317 --> 00:16:20,950
- I have to tell you, Louis,

463
00:16:20,986 --> 00:16:23,753
I haven't stopped smiling
since you told me the news.

464
00:16:23,788 --> 00:16:24,988
Have you told Mom and Dad?

465
00:16:25,023 --> 00:16:27,390
- Actually, that's the reason
I wanted to talk to you.

466
00:16:27,425 --> 00:16:29,959
- Okay.
- Sheila and I were talking.

467
00:16:29,995 --> 00:16:32,295
We're not
raising the baby Jewish.

468
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,697
I need you to help me
explain that to Mom and Dad,

469
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:37,433
and I need to know
how upset you think they'll be.

470
00:16:37,469 --> 00:16:38,613
- How much would it upset you

471
00:16:38,637 --> 00:16:41,604
to be ostracized by them
for the rest of your life?

472
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,773
- Tell you the truth,
I could think of worse things.

473
00:16:43,808 --> 00:16:45,508
- Louis.

474
00:16:45,543 --> 00:16:48,111
It would crush them,
and you know it.

475
00:16:48,146 --> 00:16:49,345
You're Jewish.

476
00:16:49,381 --> 00:16:50,913
You should
raise your children Jewish.

477
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:52,649
- Wait a second, wait a second.

478
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:56,352
You feel the same way too?

479
00:16:56,388 --> 00:16:57,965
- I think
this is between you and Sheila.

480
00:16:57,989 --> 00:17:00,356
It's not up to me.

481
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:02,458
But if you want the truth,
I always thought

482
00:17:02,494 --> 00:17:05,161
if you ever had kids, that
they would go to Camp Brucha

483
00:17:05,196 --> 00:17:07,163
like mine did,
like you and I did.

484
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:09,332
- I know. I do too.

486
00:17:11,736 --> 00:17:13,303

488
00:17:15,473 --> 00:17:17,073
- Anyway,
that's not gonna happen,

489
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:18,074
because the way
this whole thing started,

490
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:18,908
when I brought up Brucha
to Sheila,

491
00:17:18,943 --> 00:17:21,444
she nearly choked on her water.

492
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:23,446
- Wait a second,
she's driving this?

493
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:24,725
- Of course she is.
You think I want this?

494
00:17:24,749 --> 00:17:25,960
I just said
the goddamn camp pledge.

495
00:17:25,984 --> 00:17:28,251
- Then you need to tell her
how you're feeling.

496
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:29,297
- I tried
talking to her about it.

497
00:17:29,321 --> 00:17:31,187
She made it clear
she didn't want to,

498
00:17:31,222 --> 00:17:33,289
and here we are.

499
00:17:34,993 --> 00:17:37,093
Louis, I want to talk to you
about Jeffrey.

500
00:17:37,128 --> 00:17:38,561
- Jeffrey's an asshole.

501
00:17:38,596 --> 00:17:39,696
- No, he's not, Louis.

502
00:17:39,731 --> 00:17:42,332
He's the father of my children,

503
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:45,134
and the reason
our marriage fell apart

504
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,503
wasn't because of
what he did to me

505
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:51,174
but because of what
he didn't do with me.

506
00:17:51,209 --> 00:17:53,120
- Express how he felt about
you being the breadwinner.

507
00:17:53,144 --> 00:17:54,043
- Yes.

508
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:56,312
So if you want me
to help you break the news

509
00:17:56,348 --> 00:17:59,515
to Mom and Dad, I will,
but I'm not gonna do it

510
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,784
until you tell Sheila
how you're feeling.

511
00:18:05,975 --> 00:18:07,185
- All right,
what do we have here?

512
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:08,289
- I'll tell you what we have.

513
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,367
I got a building;
I don't want to sell it;

514
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:10,935
and these two are in here
crying to you.

515
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:12,158
- You don't have a lawyer?

516
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:13,434
- I don't need
a goddamn lawyer.

517
00:18:13,462 --> 00:18:14,394
- We're not crying.

518
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:16,167
We are representing
the community.

519
00:18:16,168 --> 00:18:18,316
Because that building
was built in 1896,

520
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:19,983
and all we're asking for
is a TRO

521
00:18:20,018 --> 00:18:22,507
until the landmark commission
can make a decision.

522
00:18:22,508 --> 00:18:23,474
- Give me a break.

523
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:25,376
They're not representing
the community.

524
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:26,377
They're representing David Fox.

525
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:28,746
- I did not say
he was my client.

526
00:18:28,781 --> 00:18:30,347
- And even if he did,
that doesn't mean

527
00:18:30,383 --> 00:18:32,149
this is connected to that.

528
00:18:32,184 --> 00:18:34,852
- How about the fact
that Mr. Fox has been shoveling

529
00:18:34,887 --> 00:18:36,954
my biggest tenant
tens of thousands of dollars

530
00:18:36,989 --> 00:18:41,091
a month to stay in his lease
so I couldn't kick him out?

531
00:18:41,127 --> 00:18:42,192
Is that connected?

532
00:18:42,228 --> 00:18:43,494
- What?
- Your Honor.

533
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:46,397
Those payments are repayments
for an unrelated debt.

534
00:18:46,432 --> 00:18:47,676
- Bullshit.
Peter Minto doesn't have

535
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,333
two pennies to rub together,

536
00:18:49,368 --> 00:18:51,869
much less tens of thousands
to loan David Fox.

537
00:18:51,904 --> 00:18:54,905
- And the details of someone's
personal financial arrangements

538
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,373
are not your business.

539
00:18:56,409 --> 00:18:57,409
- That's enough.

540
00:18:57,443 --> 00:18:59,109
You two want to push this
up the hill

541
00:18:59,145 --> 00:19:01,245
with the landmark commission,
be my guest,

542
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,557
but I see no reason
to stop this man

543
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:03,592
from making a living
in the meantime.

544
00:19:03,616 --> 00:19:05,416
Your restraining order
is denied.

545
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,705
- Okay, what we need to do--

546
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:11,140
- How the hell did you find out

547
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:12,742
about those payments?

548
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:13,777
I'll tell you how.

549
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:15,611
You went to Fox behind my back.

550
00:19:15,647 --> 00:19:17,613
- No.
I had your back.

551
00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:19,415
You had nothing.
I brought you something.

552
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:21,451
- Well, that something
just blew up in our faces,

553
00:19:21,486 --> 00:19:22,530
because he's been using
those payments

554
00:19:22,554 --> 00:19:25,021
to launder money,
peddle influence,

555
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:26,322
or God knows what other crime.

556
00:19:26,357 --> 00:19:28,724
- And that is exactly why
I didn't tell you,

557
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,793
because Donna told me
you don't trust him.

558
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:32,695
- You're damn right
I don't trust him.

559
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,964
Because when a man like that
hides money,

560
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:37,333
it's not because he's
secretly donating to Goodwill.

561
00:19:37,368 --> 00:19:38,968
- Harvey, he is our client.

562
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:40,236
- No. He's not.

563
00:19:40,271 --> 00:19:43,105
- You can't just drop him.
- Yes, I can.

564
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,785
Because I don't give a shit
about Donna's deal.

565
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:48,644
I'm not representing a client
that lies to my face!

566
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:54,613
What's the matter,
Mr. Newton?

567
00:19:54,648 --> 00:19:55,659
You don't look happy
to be here.

568
00:19:55,683 --> 00:19:56,683
- I'm not.

569
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:58,617
I don't appreciate
being subpoenaed.

570
00:19:58,856 --> 00:20:00,589
- Well,
if you don't appreciate that,

571
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,310
you're definitely not
gonna appreciate this.

572
00:20:05,729 --> 00:20:07,795
- You're accusing my client
of intent to defraud?

573
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,696
- That's what he did, isn't it?

574
00:20:08,732 --> 00:20:09,831
- I didn't do anything

575
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:12,166
except be a little bit late
with your barrels.

576
00:20:12,202 --> 00:20:13,245
- What you did
was entice my client

577
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:14,580
with a discount,
then sabotage his yield

578
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:15,570
because you knew
the other vintners

579
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:17,805
would make you whole.

580
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,640
- My client did no such thing.
- Yes, he did.

581
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,420
He admitted it to my face
last night, and now,

582
00:20:21,444 --> 00:20:22,377
instead of a lawsuit,

583
00:20:22,412 --> 00:20:24,278
you're looking
at criminal charges.

584
00:20:24,314 --> 00:20:26,214
- Criminal charges?
Are you out of your mind?

585
00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:27,682
They can't do this to me,
can they?

586
00:20:27,717 --> 00:20:28,683
- Look at his face.

587
00:20:28,718 --> 00:20:29,684
It says we can.

588
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:32,053
It should be more than that,
you son of a bitch.

589
00:20:32,088 --> 00:20:32,954
- What the hell
is your problem?

590
00:20:32,989 --> 00:20:34,166
- You know what my problem is?

591
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,491
The oldest problem in the book
for a man like me.

592
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,870
And I'm putting a stop to it
right now.

593
00:20:37,894 --> 00:20:41,329
- Race? Race, is that what
you think this is about?

594
00:20:41,364 --> 00:20:43,364
- I know
that's what this is about.

595
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,699
- Oh, you pompous
piece of shit.

596
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:46,334
- Miles.
- No, no.

597
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:48,347
I am not gonna sit here
and let him accuse me of that.

598
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:50,538
You want to know why
you didn't get your barrels?

599
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:52,106
Because you don't deserve them.

600
00:20:52,142 --> 00:20:53,875
- And there it is.
- No, no, no, no.

601
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,954
See, our families have worked

602
00:20:54,978 --> 00:20:56,477
those vineyards
for generations,

603
00:20:56,513 --> 00:20:58,346
and you just come
waltzing in here

604
00:20:58,381 --> 00:21:01,015
with your Wall Street money,
acting like you own the place,

605
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,817
and you've been here
for, what, ten minutes?

606
00:21:02,852 --> 00:21:05,086
We've been here
our whole lives.

607
00:21:05,121 --> 00:21:07,188
You bought out that man
before you

608
00:21:07,223 --> 00:21:09,657
after he had one down year.

609
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:11,492
And we're not gonna let you
get away with it.

610
00:21:11,528 --> 00:21:13,428
- You tell yourself
whatever you want.

611
00:21:13,463 --> 00:21:15,296
But you're right
about one thing.

612
00:21:15,331 --> 00:21:17,064
I'm a big, bad motherfucker,

613
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,034
and I'm here to drink
your goddamn milkshake.

614
00:21:30,746 --> 00:21:31,712
- Let me guess,
Samantha told you

615
00:21:31,747 --> 00:21:33,614
what I'm about to do.
- Yeah, she did.

616
00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:35,082
- Oh, so she keeps shit from me

617
00:21:35,117 --> 00:21:35,883
but shares it with you.

618
00:21:35,918 --> 00:21:36,884
- Don't make this about her.

619
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:38,919
She does what she wants,
just like you do.

620
00:21:38,954 --> 00:21:40,665
- You're taking her side?
- I'm taking my side.

621
00:21:40,689 --> 00:21:42,389
Because you may be done
with this case,

622
00:21:42,425 --> 00:21:43,502
but she's
gonna keep working on it

623
00:21:43,526 --> 00:21:45,893
because, unlike you,
she cares about my reputation.

624
00:21:45,928 --> 00:21:47,239
- You think
I don't care about you?

625
00:21:47,263 --> 00:21:49,496
You're in your position
because I put you there.

626
00:21:49,532 --> 00:21:50,772
- No, Harvey,
I'm in my position

627
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,600
because I fucking earned it!

628
00:21:53,636 --> 00:21:55,936
Now, if you want to talk
about things you did,

629
00:21:55,971 --> 00:21:58,072
you authorized me
to negotiate this deal,

630
00:21:58,107 --> 00:22:00,607
and if you don't honor it,
Fox is gonna tell the world,

631
00:22:00,643 --> 00:22:01,686
and how's that gonna go
the next time

632
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,577
I try to come to an agreement
with anyone?

633
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:05,846
- It'll go fine
because he has no integrity.

634
00:22:05,881 --> 00:22:08,015
Nobody will believe him.
- Okay.

635
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,819
Let me put this in words
that you'll understand.

636
00:22:11,854 --> 00:22:13,687
I have integrity.

637
00:22:13,722 --> 00:22:15,856
You let him go,
you're making me a liar.

638
00:22:15,891 --> 00:22:17,069
- You want to talk
about a liar?

639
00:22:17,093 --> 00:22:18,659
He lied to my face.

640
00:22:18,694 --> 00:22:19,974
- And so have
a thousand other clients.

641
00:22:19,975 --> 00:22:21,505
You were just waiting
for an opportunity

642
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,783
to let him go.
- Because we never

643
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:24,210
should've taken him
on in the first place.

644
00:22:24,211 --> 00:22:25,571
- Well, we did,
and like I said,

645
00:22:25,572 --> 00:22:27,412
you drop him,
you're making me a liar.

646
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:29,243
And I don't care if the rest
of the world knows it or not.

647
00:22:29,244 --> 00:22:32,211
You'll know it,
and I'll know it.

648
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:33,846
Now, you go ahead
and do what you want.

649
00:22:33,882 --> 00:22:35,848
You always do anyway.

650
00:22:43,524 --> 00:22:46,692
- Louis, what a surprise.
I was just reading.

651
00:22:46,728 --> 00:22:49,729
- Listen.
Sheila... we need to talk.

652
00:22:49,764 --> 00:22:50,997
- About what?

653
00:22:51,032 --> 00:22:53,132
- I want to raise
our child Jewish.

654
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:54,345
- Louis, I thought
we talked about this.

655
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:55,134
- No, Sheila, we didn't,

656
00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:55,935
because we were celebrating,

657
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:56,736
and you told me to let it go.

658
00:22:56,771 --> 00:22:58,838
And I tried to let it go,

659
00:22:58,873 --> 00:22:59,839
but then I talked to Esther.

660
00:22:59,874 --> 00:23:01,274
And now I can't.

661
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:02,275
- Okay, so you talked to Esther

662
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,043
after you said
we wouldn't tell anyone yet?

663
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:06,913
- Yes, I did,
because she's my family.

664
00:23:06,948 --> 00:23:08,058
- I get it,
so you and your sister

665
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:11,684
have a long conversation
about Sheila, the shiksa.

666
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:12,730
- Sheila, it's not like that.

667
00:23:12,754 --> 00:23:15,955
Esther helped me realize
that I don't care

668
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,056
what my parents think.

669
00:23:17,091 --> 00:23:18,958
I don't care what
your parents think.

670
00:23:18,993 --> 00:23:20,104
It's what's important to me.

671
00:23:20,128 --> 00:23:21,272
- And how about
what's important to me?

672
00:23:21,296 --> 00:23:22,706
- That's why
I want to talk this out.

673
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:26,265
Because I don't want to end up
resenting you for this.

674
00:23:26,301 --> 00:23:27,478
- And I don't want
to resent you either,

675
00:23:27,502 --> 00:23:31,370
so why don't you tell me why
this is so important to you.

676
00:23:31,406 --> 00:23:34,340
- What's so important is that
it's a part of who I am.

677
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:37,109
- And being Catholic
is a part of who I am.

678
00:23:37,145 --> 00:23:38,489
- But you said
you were not religious.

679
00:23:38,513 --> 00:23:39,478
- And so did you.

680
00:23:39,514 --> 00:23:43,082
- That's what I am trying
to explain to you.

681
00:23:43,117 --> 00:23:47,486
Being Jewish
isn't just a religion to me.

682
00:23:47,522 --> 00:23:48,988
It's in my blood.

683
00:23:49,023 --> 00:23:50,100
- And you don't think
it's the same for me?

684
00:23:50,124 --> 00:23:51,535
- No, I don't.
- Then you don't get it.

685
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:54,293
Because when I said
my parents wouldn't like this,

686
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:57,363
what I meant was,
the people who raised me,

687
00:23:57,398 --> 00:24:00,866
who are my blood,
have had a hard enough time

688
00:24:00,902 --> 00:24:03,102
accepting the fact
that I don't practice anymore.

689
00:24:03,137 --> 00:24:04,971
And I don't want
to separate myself from them

690
00:24:05,006 --> 00:24:06,973
by telling them that my child

691
00:24:07,008 --> 00:24:10,142
is going to be different
than all of us.

692
00:24:10,178 --> 00:24:11,255
- Sheila, I can't just
rip this out of me.

693
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,980
- Louis, I'm not asking you
to rip it out of you.

694
00:24:14,015 --> 00:24:16,716
I just don't want to raise
our child one way or another.

695
00:24:16,751 --> 00:24:18,718
- You know what, to me,
it's the same damn thing.

696
00:24:18,753 --> 00:24:19,897
- Then I don't know
what to tell you.

697
00:24:19,921 --> 00:24:21,687
- Neither do I.

698
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,193
Neither do I.

699
00:24:30,297 --> 00:24:32,564
- Samantha, can I talk to you
for a minute?

700
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,700
- Looks like you need
more than that.

701
00:24:34,735 --> 00:24:37,302
- I tried to talk Harvey
out of dropping Fox,

702
00:24:37,338 --> 00:24:39,004
but I'm not sure
I convinced him.

703
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,405
- And?
- I told him you said

704
00:24:40,441 --> 00:24:42,407
you'd keep working on the case
anyway.

705
00:24:42,443 --> 00:24:44,376
- That's funny,
because I didn't say that.

706
00:24:44,411 --> 00:24:46,645
- No. You didn't.

707
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,924
But the reason
I told him you did is--

708
00:24:47,948 --> 00:24:49,226
- Because you gave Fox
your word.

709
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,984
And even if Harvey doesn't
live up to it, I can.

710
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:53,785
- Exactly.

711
00:24:53,821 --> 00:24:55,131
- It looks like I've got
some more work to do.

712
00:24:55,155 --> 00:24:57,789
Because I'm not gonna
make a liar out of you.

713
00:24:57,825 --> 00:25:00,425
- Thank you, Samantha.
- No need to thank me, Donna.

714
00:25:00,461 --> 00:25:03,395
I'm sure
you'd do the same for me.

715
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:08,600
- Louis, what's going on?

716
00:25:08,636 --> 00:25:12,070
It's not usual for you to come
in so many times in one week.

717
00:25:12,106 --> 00:25:14,239
What did Harvey get into now?

718
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:15,552
- This isn't about Harvey.
It's about Sheila.

719
00:25:15,576 --> 00:25:18,343
I need you to convince her
to raise our children Jewish.

720
00:25:18,379 --> 00:25:19,878
- Louis,
I'm not going to do that.

721
00:25:19,914 --> 00:25:21,213
- Why not?

722
00:25:21,248 --> 00:25:22,626
I know she came
to see you that time.

723
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,528
Did you think I wouldn't
find out about that one?

724
00:25:24,552 --> 00:25:25,762
- No,
I assumed you would find out

725
00:25:25,786 --> 00:25:28,153
when I explicitly told her
to tell you about it.

726
00:25:28,188 --> 00:25:29,432
- Well, if you can order her
to do that,

727
00:25:29,456 --> 00:25:31,957
why can't you order her
to raise our children Jewish?

728
00:25:31,992 --> 00:25:34,626
What kind of therapist are you?

729
00:25:34,662 --> 00:25:36,228
- Louis.

730
00:25:36,263 --> 00:25:38,163
I know
I've told you this before,

731
00:25:38,198 --> 00:25:39,965
and I know
you refuse to believe me,

732
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,301
but my parents were Jews
in Nazi Germany,

733
00:25:42,336 --> 00:25:43,380
and there was a point for them

734
00:25:43,404 --> 00:25:46,104
where they discussed
renouncing their Judaism

735
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,873
for a chance
to save their lives.

736
00:25:47,908 --> 00:25:49,808
They didn't.

737
00:25:49,843 --> 00:25:52,911
So I understand
as much as anyone

738
00:25:52,947 --> 00:25:55,781
the value of maintaining
a Jewish identity.

739
00:25:55,816 --> 00:25:57,482
- But?
- But, to me,

740
00:25:57,518 --> 00:26:00,586
the heart of Judaism is family.

741
00:26:00,621 --> 00:26:02,087
- What're you saying?

742
00:26:02,122 --> 00:26:03,333
- I'm saying,
if you can't be on

743
00:26:03,357 --> 00:26:06,892
the same page about how
to raise your children,

744
00:26:06,927 --> 00:26:08,860
maybe you should discuss
not having them.

745
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:14,266
- It's too late for that.

746
00:26:14,301 --> 00:26:15,233
- Ah.

747
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:17,169
Then, Louis,

748
00:26:17,204 --> 00:26:19,771
I would say it's more important

749
00:26:19,807 --> 00:26:21,673
that you make a decision
together

750
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:23,942
than what that decision is.

751
00:26:23,978 --> 00:26:25,510
- Thanks, Stan.

752
00:26:25,546 --> 00:26:27,379
- You're welcome, Louis.

753
00:26:27,414 --> 00:26:31,817
And there's just one more
small matter before we move on.

754
00:26:31,852 --> 00:26:33,719
- What's that?

755
00:26:36,023 --> 00:26:37,322
- Mazel tov, my friend.

756
00:26:37,358 --> 00:26:39,625
Mazel tov.

757
00:26:47,934 --> 00:26:48,766
- Where have you been?

758
00:26:48,802 --> 00:26:50,768
- I gave you a chance
to calm down.

759
00:26:50,804 --> 00:26:51,948
Because, Robert,
we need to talk.

760
00:26:51,972 --> 00:26:53,538
- We do.

761
00:26:53,573 --> 00:26:55,607
About how
we're gonna make them pay.

762
00:26:55,642 --> 00:26:56,708
- That's the thing.

763
00:26:56,743 --> 00:26:58,710
I think we should try
to work this out.

764
00:26:58,745 --> 00:27:00,612
- Are you goddamn kidding me?

765
00:27:00,647 --> 00:27:01,724
- Robert, he admitted
to a crime

766
00:27:01,748 --> 00:27:03,748
to convince us
he was telling us the truth.

767
00:27:03,783 --> 00:27:05,294
- Because he probably believes
his own bullshit.

768
00:27:05,318 --> 00:27:07,085
Well, I don't care
what he believes.

769
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,187
There's no way, if I'm white,

770
00:27:09,222 --> 00:27:10,188
we're in this situation
right now.

771
00:27:10,223 --> 00:27:12,557
- I'm not gonna tell you
you're wrong.

772
00:27:12,592 --> 00:27:14,537
But you are wrong about
how to handle this situation.

773
00:27:14,561 --> 00:27:16,094
- What is that
supposed to mean?

774
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:17,829
- It means
we take him at his word.

775
00:27:17,864 --> 00:27:19,898
- Okay.

776
00:27:19,933 --> 00:27:21,533
Let's say that you're right

777
00:27:21,568 --> 00:27:24,702
and this is more about my money
than the color of my skin.

778
00:27:24,738 --> 00:27:26,371
I'm not gonna let
that son of a bitch

779
00:27:26,406 --> 00:27:28,339
push me out
no matter what the reason.

780
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:29,385
I've been putting up
with this shit

781
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:31,476
for more years
than you've been on this earth,

782
00:27:31,511 --> 00:27:33,411
and I've accepted
that the way to deal with it

783
00:27:33,446 --> 00:27:34,646
is to bury a part of myself.

784
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:36,314
Well, I don't
have to do that anymore,

785
00:27:36,349 --> 00:27:37,393
and you're gonna do what I say.

786
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:38,383
- No, sir, I'm not,

787
00:27:38,418 --> 00:27:40,084
because the world's
a shitty place

788
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,230
and I'm not
gonna make it worse.

789
00:27:41,254 --> 00:27:42,865
And I don't give a shit
if you're my boss.

790
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:43,855
I'm your goddamn lawyer.

791
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,789
And you're either
gonna take my advice

792
00:27:44,824 --> 00:27:47,091
or you can hire someone else.

793
00:27:47,127 --> 00:27:49,272
- Then call yourself a car,
and get the hell out of here.

794
00:27:49,296 --> 00:27:50,395
I'll handle it myself.

795
00:28:01,093 --> 00:28:02,973
I hope you're here to tell me
you got it done.

796
00:28:03,209 --> 00:28:05,003
- I'm here to give you
one last chance.

797
00:28:05,004 --> 00:28:06,842
'Cause I know
about the payments

798
00:28:06,843 --> 00:28:09,469
to Peter Minto,
and so does Billows.

799
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:12,565
- Shit.

800
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:13,991
Well, how much does he know?

801
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,135
- I'm not here
about what he knows.

802
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:17,190
I'm here about what I don't,
because I asked you

803
00:28:17,191 --> 00:28:19,580
if something shady is going on,
you lied to my face,

804
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:21,602
and the only reason
I haven't dropped you yet

805
00:28:21,603 --> 00:28:22,735
is Donna gave you her word.

806
00:28:22,771 --> 00:28:24,124
- You know what,
you wouldn't understand.

807
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:25,615
- I understand
money laundering,

808
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:27,375
and, knowing the kind
of man you are,

809
00:28:27,376 --> 00:28:29,008
it's exactly what's
going on here.

810
00:28:29,044 --> 00:28:30,871
- You know, you don't know shit
about the kind of man I am.

811
00:28:30,872 --> 00:28:31,971
- Then tell me right now.

812
00:28:32,007 --> 00:28:33,740
What the hell
is Peter Minto giving you

813
00:28:33,775 --> 00:28:36,275
in exchange
for $10,000 a month?

814
00:28:40,015 --> 00:28:41,415
It was nice
representing you, David.

815
00:28:42,684 --> 00:28:44,320
- It's not what he's giving me.

816
00:28:45,556 --> 00:28:48,156
It's what he gave me.

817
00:28:48,191 --> 00:28:49,891
- What does that mean?

818
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:53,828
- I was 13 years old.
I didn't have any money.

819
00:28:53,864 --> 00:28:55,697
I needed a pack of cigarettes.

820
00:28:55,732 --> 00:28:57,966
So I took one
from Minto's Market.

821
00:28:58,001 --> 00:28:59,579
And then I thought, you know,
while I'm at it,

822
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:01,047
I might as well take
a bunch of other shit.

823
00:29:01,071 --> 00:29:02,382
- He didn't press charges.
- No, he didn't.

824
00:29:02,406 --> 00:29:04,639
But he did make me work it off.

825
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:06,209
Next thing I knew,
he took me under his wing.

826
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,144
Look, I gave him that money
because if I didn't,

827
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:10,412
he'd go out of business,

828
00:29:10,447 --> 00:29:11,947
and if I can't
get this building,

829
00:29:11,982 --> 00:29:13,193
he's gonna
go out of business anyway.

830
00:29:13,217 --> 00:29:15,526
- Why didn't you just tell me
this in the first place?

831
00:29:15,527 --> 00:29:19,796
- For the same reason
I don't want anyone to know it.

832
00:29:19,831 --> 00:29:22,599
All right, I need people
to believe that I'm ruthless.

833
00:29:22,634 --> 00:29:25,635
- Well, wouldn't you rather
have people know you're loyal

834
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,503
than have them think
you're an asshole?

835
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:28,649
- Look, Peter Minto taught me
how to do business

836
00:29:28,673 --> 00:29:29,784
as a gentleman,
but there's a reason

837
00:29:29,808 --> 00:29:32,642
he can't keep his business
alive and I can.

838
00:29:32,677 --> 00:29:33,943
- Well...

839
00:29:33,979 --> 00:29:37,947
I can't say I agree with you...

840
00:29:37,983 --> 00:29:40,450
but I'll get you your building.

841
00:29:46,688 --> 00:29:48,287
<i>- Donna. You're up late.</i>

842
00:29:48,323 --> 00:29:49,800
- I'm up late because you said

843
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:50,700
this thing would be done
by now,

844
00:29:50,735 --> 00:29:52,535
and I haven't heard from you,

845
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,438
which makes me wonder...
how's it going?

846
00:29:55,473 --> 00:29:56,673
<i>- I'll tell you</i>
<i>how it's going.</i>

847
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:58,608
Instead of getting closer
with Alex,

848
00:29:58,643 --> 00:30:00,143
I had to send him packing.

849
00:30:00,178 --> 00:30:01,511
<i>- What? How did that happen?</i>

850
00:30:01,546 --> 00:30:02,923
- It happened
because I'm his client

851
00:30:02,947 --> 00:30:05,248
and he wouldn't listen
to a word I said.

852
00:30:05,283 --> 00:30:06,494
- Look,
I want to say something,

853
00:30:06,518 --> 00:30:07,795
but I'm hesitant to say it
because it's not something

854
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:09,263
I would normally say
to a managing partner.

855
00:30:09,287 --> 00:30:12,422
- Speak your mind.
<i>- Well, I don't know</i>

856
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:13,956
<i>what the issue is,</i>
<i>but I do know</i>

857
00:30:13,992 --> 00:30:15,469
when a lawyer and a client
have a falling out,

858
00:30:15,493 --> 00:30:18,428
more often than not,
it's because

859
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:19,774
the client wouldn't listen
to the lawyer,

860
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:20,997
<i>not the other way around.</i>

861
00:30:21,032 --> 00:30:23,032
<i>In particular,</i>
<i>when that lawyer</i>

862
00:30:23,067 --> 00:30:24,634
<i>is Alex Williams.</i>

863
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:25,968
- Is that all?
<i>- That's it.</i>

864
00:30:26,004 --> 00:30:29,505
I hope you get whatever it is
taken care of, Robert.

865
00:30:33,678 --> 00:30:35,311
- Are you still working
the Fox case?

866
00:30:35,346 --> 00:30:37,079
- I believe
Donna told you I was,

867
00:30:37,115 --> 00:30:39,782
and Donna's no liar, why?

868
00:30:39,818 --> 00:30:42,018
- Because I'm back in.

869
00:30:42,053 --> 00:30:43,330
- What changed your mind?
- Fox did.

870
00:30:43,354 --> 00:30:47,089
Turns out those payments
were because Peter Minto

871
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,257
was Fox's mentor.

872
00:30:48,293 --> 00:30:49,437
He wasn't laundering anything.

873
00:30:49,461 --> 00:30:50,827
He was trying
to save that market.

874
00:30:50,862 --> 00:30:54,096
- So he was basically donating
to Goodwill after all.

875
00:30:54,132 --> 00:30:55,631
- I guess he was.

876
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:57,733
- Wait a minute.

877
00:30:57,769 --> 00:30:59,402
Goodwill.

878
00:30:59,437 --> 00:31:01,270
Public good.
- What do you got?

879
00:31:01,306 --> 00:31:02,416
- There's a public good
requirement for any project.

880
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,340
- Yeah, and this one
has it covered

881
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:05,641
with the subsidized housing.

882
00:31:05,677 --> 00:31:06,509
- Because that way,

883
00:31:06,544 --> 00:31:08,311
his Chinese investors
have to cover it.

884
00:31:08,346 --> 00:31:09,312
- How do you know that?

885
00:31:09,347 --> 00:31:10,724
- Because I got a copy
of their agreement,

886
00:31:10,748 --> 00:31:11,981
and if that good

887
00:31:12,016 --> 00:31:13,127
is residential,
they take the hit.

888
00:31:13,151 --> 00:31:14,228
If it's commercial,
Billows does,

889
00:31:14,252 --> 00:31:18,054
and Minto's Market
is a commercial public good.

890
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:20,790
- Which means all we need to do
is tell those Chinese investors

891
00:31:20,825 --> 00:31:22,525
their trusted partner's
been screwing them.

892
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,193
- And Billows either loses
his partners

893
00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:25,394
or foots the bill himself.

894
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:28,130
which puts him between a rock
and a hard place.

895
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:31,968
- And his only way out
is to sell to David Fox.

896
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:32,935
- Look at that.

897
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:35,071
We make a pretty good team,
don't we?

898
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:36,906
- Maybe.

899
00:31:36,941 --> 00:31:38,140
But the only problem is,

900
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:41,377
it makes this whole project
a money loser for Fox.

901
00:31:41,412 --> 00:31:43,679
- So what? He said he's been
subsidizing Minto anyway.

902
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:45,715
- Privately.
This is in the public eye,

903
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,027
which means
everyone's gonna think

904
00:31:47,051 --> 00:31:49,685
he's either soft or stupid,
and I'm telling you,

905
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:51,420
it's that man's
worst nightmare.

906
00:31:51,456 --> 00:31:53,356
- What do you want to do?

907
00:31:53,391 --> 00:31:54,891
- Can you get to the Chinese?
- I can.

908
00:31:56,828 --> 00:31:59,529
- You handle them,
and I'll handle David Fox.

909
00:31:59,564 --> 00:32:01,764
- Sounds like a plan.

910
00:32:03,268 --> 00:32:05,201
- Are you sure
you can handle them?

911
00:32:05,236 --> 00:32:06,569
<i>- Ni gan dadu wo keyi.</i>

912
00:32:06,604 --> 00:32:09,572
- Yeah,
but can you handle them?

913
00:32:19,183 --> 00:32:21,617
- What now?
- I'm calling to say I'm sorry.

914
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:22,385
I lost my shit.

915
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,286
<i>- Truth is,</i>

916
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:24,854
<i>if I was in your position,</i>

917
00:32:24,889 --> 00:32:26,289
I'd probably feel the same way.

918
00:32:26,324 --> 00:32:27,690
<i>- Well,</i>
<i>you're not in my position.</i>

919
00:32:27,725 --> 00:32:28,691
<i>You're my lawyer.</i>

920
00:32:28,726 --> 00:32:29,904
And if I'm not
gonna listen to you

921
00:32:29,928 --> 00:32:31,961
and go ahead
and handle this thing myself...

922
00:32:31,996 --> 00:32:33,996
- You've got a fool
for a client.

923
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,767
- Something like that.

924
00:32:37,802 --> 00:32:39,802
Anyway, I think I may
have a way through this.

925
00:32:39,837 --> 00:32:40,636
- What you got?

926
00:32:40,672 --> 00:32:42,004
<i>- You said that you wanted</i>

927
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,872
<i>to take them at their word.</i>

928
00:32:42,907 --> 00:32:44,707
If we did that, the problem is,

929
00:32:44,742 --> 00:32:48,778
we're dealing with a community
that feels threatened.

930
00:32:48,813 --> 00:32:50,012
So I was thinking,

931
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:52,448
insurance covers my losses
this year.

932
00:32:52,483 --> 00:32:54,016
<i>Next year,</i>
<i>my barrels are free,</i>

933
00:32:54,052 --> 00:32:56,752
and then I can build
a community tasting room

934
00:32:56,788 --> 00:32:57,887
that we all can share.

935
00:32:57,922 --> 00:32:58,966
<i>- That's very generous of you,</i>
<i>Robert.</i>

936
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,401
Mind if I ask you
what brought you around?

937
00:33:00,425 --> 00:33:04,827
<i>- Two things.</i>
<i>A conversation with a friend.</i>

938
00:33:04,862 --> 00:33:06,395
<i>- And?</i>

939
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:09,932
- Where I grew up,
community was everything.

940
00:33:09,968 --> 00:33:11,934
We were tight and close,

941
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:15,638
mistrusting of outsiders,
and...

942
00:33:15,673 --> 00:33:18,574
if someone had come in
and done what I did to them...

943
00:33:20,845 --> 00:33:23,079
<i>The community wouldn't</i>
<i>have taken too kindly to it,</i>

944
00:33:23,114 --> 00:33:24,780
no matter what
the color of their skin.

945
00:33:26,884 --> 00:33:30,419
So I thought maybe we're not
so different after all.

946
00:33:30,455 --> 00:33:31,587
- Copy that.

947
00:33:31,623 --> 00:33:34,190
- So you're gonna propose
all of that to them tomorrow.

948
00:33:34,225 --> 00:33:35,558
<i>- Robert, I think</i>

949
00:33:35,593 --> 00:33:37,393
if you're gonna be
a part of this community,

950
00:33:37,428 --> 00:33:38,772
we ought to propose it
to them together.

951
00:33:38,796 --> 00:33:40,007
<i>- So get your ass</i>
<i>back up here then.</i>

952
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:45,401
And Alex... don't ever
call me a fool again.

953
00:33:52,543 --> 00:33:55,478
- Welcome home, Louis.

954
00:33:55,513 --> 00:33:56,579
- Is that...

955
00:33:56,614 --> 00:33:59,015
- Yes, it is.

956
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,583
Your mother's kugel.

957
00:34:00,618 --> 00:34:02,218
- How did you...

958
00:34:02,253 --> 00:34:04,987
- Your sister called.
- Don't tell me.

959
00:34:05,023 --> 00:34:06,233
She tried to convince you
to see it my way.

960
00:34:06,257 --> 00:34:08,190
- No, Louis, she called

961
00:34:08,226 --> 00:34:09,558
to tell me, whatever happens,

962
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:10,760
she loves me

963
00:34:10,795 --> 00:34:13,496
and wants to welcome me
to the family.

964
00:34:13,531 --> 00:34:14,864
- So why the kugel?

965
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:16,677
- Because my sister never
would have done that for me.

966
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:17,667
Louis, I may not be ready

967
00:34:17,702 --> 00:34:18,812
to make this decision
right now,

968
00:34:18,836 --> 00:34:21,871
but what we were
really struggling with

969
00:34:21,906 --> 00:34:24,840
was how to blend
our identities.

970
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:27,009
So I thought,
what better way to do that

971
00:34:27,045 --> 00:34:29,011
than by starting with kugel?

972
00:34:30,481 --> 00:34:32,782
- Well, if we're gonna
be doing that,

973
00:34:32,817 --> 00:34:33,683
I don't see
why we can't also have

974
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:36,118
a Christmas tree this year.

975
00:34:36,154 --> 00:34:37,987
- You'd be open to that?
- Yes, I would.

976
00:34:39,824 --> 00:34:41,457
Because I saw
Dr. Lipschitz today.

977
00:34:41,492 --> 00:34:43,793
Sheila, he reminded me

978
00:34:43,828 --> 00:34:46,295
that the foundation
of everything is family.

979
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,066
So I've been thinking...

980
00:34:50,101 --> 00:34:53,102
- Stop right there.
I've been thinking too.

981
00:34:53,137 --> 00:34:56,572
You asked me last time.

982
00:34:56,607 --> 00:34:59,175
I'd like to ask you this time.

983
00:35:02,613 --> 00:35:04,814
Louis Marlowe Litt...

984
00:35:06,517 --> 00:35:08,317
Will you marry me?

985
00:35:08,352 --> 00:35:09,719
- Yes, Sheila, I will.

986
00:35:21,534 --> 00:35:22,567
- Morning.

987
00:35:22,602 --> 00:35:24,802
I was just thinking
about our wedding.

988
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:25,937
- Louis...

989
00:35:25,972 --> 00:35:29,407
- I was thinking maybe
we can make it a destination.

990
00:35:29,442 --> 00:35:31,420
- I don't want to talk
about our wedding right now.

991
00:35:31,444 --> 00:35:32,343
- Why not?

992
00:35:32,379 --> 00:35:34,746
- I got my period.
I'm not pregnant.

993
00:35:34,781 --> 00:35:37,415
- But the test said that you--
- It was a false positive.

994
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:40,718
- Hey.

995
00:35:40,754 --> 00:35:44,722
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

996
00:35:44,758 --> 00:35:45,590
You know what this is?

997
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:48,192
It's just a bump in the road.

998
00:35:48,228 --> 00:35:49,727
That's all this is.

999
00:35:49,763 --> 00:35:52,563
Just a pause.

1000
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:54,065
And sweetie,
there's a bright side.

1001
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,111
Because it gave us a chance

1002
00:35:55,135 --> 00:35:58,236
to have
really tough conversations.

1003
00:35:58,271 --> 00:36:00,338
And that way,
when we do get pregnant,

1004
00:36:00,373 --> 00:36:04,876
and we will get pregnant,

1005
00:36:04,911 --> 00:36:08,312
we'll be ready in a way
that we weren't ready before.

1006
00:36:13,453 --> 00:36:15,920
Are you okay?

1007
00:36:15,955 --> 00:36:18,723
- I will be.

1008
00:36:18,758 --> 00:36:21,726
Please tell me you didn't tell
anyone other than Esther.

1009
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:24,929
- I told Gretchen.

1010
00:36:24,964 --> 00:36:27,031
- You need to untell her that.

1011
00:36:34,007 --> 00:36:35,073
- Hello, Robert.

1012
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:37,408
I assume you're calling me
with good news.

1013
00:36:37,444 --> 00:36:38,643
<i>- How do you know that?</i>

1014
00:36:38,678 --> 00:36:41,279
- Don't you know by now I have
a sense for these things?

1015
00:36:41,314 --> 00:36:43,577
- I just wanted to call
and say thank you, Donna.

1016
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:44,443
We worked it out.

1017
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:45,378
<i>- You and Alex?</i>

1018
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:48,781
- Me, Alex, everybody up here.

1019
00:36:48,816 --> 00:36:50,783
And it wouldn't have happened

1020
00:36:50,818 --> 00:36:52,485
without you calling me
on my shit.

1021
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,854
- You know how they say doctors
make the worst patients?

1022
00:36:54,889 --> 00:36:55,922
<i>- Same goes for lawyers?</i>

1023
00:36:55,957 --> 00:36:58,758
- No.
Lawyers are much worse.

1024
00:36:58,793 --> 00:37:00,826
<i>- I guess they are.</i>

1025
00:37:00,862 --> 00:37:02,540
Which is why I'm glad
I have someone like you.

1026
00:37:02,564 --> 00:37:04,497
<i>- Wow... calling to thank me,</i>

1027
00:37:04,532 --> 00:37:05,998
valuing my leadership,
and giving me

1028
00:37:06,034 --> 00:37:09,569
an endearing nickname--
Robert, if we're not careful,

1029
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:13,105
we could become
full-blown friends.

1030
00:37:13,141 --> 00:37:15,308
- Oh, that's a chance
I'm willing to take.

1031
00:37:15,343 --> 00:37:17,143
- See you soon, Pops.

1032
00:37:17,178 --> 00:37:18,277
- Right back at you, Red.

1033
00:37:31,255 --> 00:37:32,717
<i>- Let me get this straight,</i>
<i>you're telling me</i>

1034
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:34,229
you can get me the building,
but it's gonna

1035
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:35,819
cost me more
to keep Peter in business

1036
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:36,687
than I was paying
in the first place?

1037
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:38,188
- And on top of that,

1038
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:39,634
the whole world's
gonna know about it,

1039
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:41,469
because Billows is gonna
make sure they know it.

1040
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:42,904
- Are you trying
to stick it to me even more?

1041
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:43,860
- I want you to know
the cost of this thing

1042
00:37:43,896 --> 00:37:45,696
before you make a decision.

1043
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:46,930
- This is bullshit.

1044
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:47,764
- David.
- God damn it.

1045
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,032
You could have done better.

1046
00:37:49,068 --> 00:37:50,211
- And you could've told me
the full fucking story

1047
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:53,570
before I only had two days
to stop it.

1048
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,640
- So either
I look like a sucker

1049
00:37:56,675 --> 00:38:00,110
or I let the guy who gave me
my start go out of business.

1050
00:38:00,145 --> 00:38:02,546
- Helping Peter Minto
stay in business

1051
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:04,281
doesn't make you a sucker.

1052
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:06,717
- It does to the world.

1053
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:11,521
- David,
the deal is what it is.

1054
00:38:11,557 --> 00:38:15,225
If I could make it any better,
I would, but I can't.

1055
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:19,629
- What would you do?

1056
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:21,498
- As your lawyer, I'd tell you

1057
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:24,634
get your emotions in check.

1058
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,536
It's a shitty deal
and a stupid move.

1059
00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:29,106
But if I were in your shoes,
I'd take it.

1060
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:35,912
- Take it.

1061
00:38:35,948 --> 00:38:37,759
- You know, I never thought
I'd be saying this,

1062
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:42,219
but... you earned my respect.

1063
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:49,804
- Well, don't you look like
the cat that ate the canary.

1064
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:53,063
- I do. And that canary's name
is Robert Zane.

1065
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:54,064
- Let me guess.

1066
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:56,500
He called you and started
unleashing compliments

1067
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:57,567
like you were his family.

1068
00:38:57,603 --> 00:38:59,536
- How'd you know?

1069
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:00,871
- He gets like that sometimes.

1070
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:02,672
- Well, I was thinking
that I wanted

1071
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:04,646
to treat him like family
right back,

1072
00:39:04,647 --> 00:39:06,124
and maybe you could
give me some advice

1073
00:39:06,148 --> 00:39:07,181
on getting him a gift.

1074
00:39:07,216 --> 00:39:09,883
- Oh, no, Donna.
You don't want to do that.

1075
00:39:09,919 --> 00:39:11,919
- What? Why not?

1076
00:39:11,954 --> 00:39:13,687
- He's a terrible
gift receiver.

1077
00:39:13,723 --> 00:39:14,855
- You're kidding.

1078
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,156
- I once gave him
vintage copies

1079
00:39:16,192 --> 00:39:18,292
of "Inherit the Wind,"
"To Kill a Mockingbird,"

1080
00:39:18,327 --> 00:39:20,194
and "Twelve Angry Men"
for his birthday.

1081
00:39:20,229 --> 00:39:21,962
The next year,
I found them in his drawer

1082
00:39:21,997 --> 00:39:24,431
with the bow still tied on.

1083
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:26,834
He's a lawyer.
They're books about the law.

1084
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:28,602
- Did you say something?
- No.

1085
00:39:28,637 --> 00:39:29,948
I just took them back.
He didn't even notice.

1086
00:39:29,972 --> 00:39:33,006
I'm gonna regift it to him
when he retires.

1087
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:34,842
What?

1088
00:39:34,877 --> 00:39:35,976
- Harvey's the opposite.

1089
00:39:36,011 --> 00:39:38,379
- Great gift receiver.
- Awful gift giver.

1090
00:39:38,414 --> 00:39:40,158
Heart's in the right place,
but two weeks in,

1091
00:39:40,182 --> 00:39:41,115
I realized
if I ever really wanted

1092
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,950
to enjoy my birthday present,

1093
00:39:42,985 --> 00:39:44,262
I was gonna
have to buy it myself.

1094
00:39:44,286 --> 00:39:45,252
- Do you still?

1095
00:39:45,287 --> 00:39:47,254
- Got these for the last one.

1096
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:49,423
32,
if you're wondering.

1097
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:50,491
Speak of the devil.

1098
00:39:50,526 --> 00:39:51,670
Look who's walking in
empty-handed.

1099
00:39:51,694 --> 00:39:55,295
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing, Harvey.

1100
00:39:56,832 --> 00:39:59,967
- Well, as long as
you're both here,

1101
00:40:00,002 --> 00:40:01,969
you weren't just right
about Fox.

1102
00:40:02,004 --> 00:40:04,605
You were right about taking him
on in the first place,

1103
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,275
and you were also right
about getting her to help me.

1104
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,750
- If I didn't know any better,
Donna,

1105
00:40:09,779 --> 00:40:11,812
I'd say
he's apologizing to you.

1106
00:40:11,847 --> 00:40:13,425
- That's funny, I was thinking
he was apologizing to you.

1107
00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:15,127
- Well, I can understand
why we're both confused.

1108
00:40:15,151 --> 00:40:16,161
It's a pretty weak apology.

1109
00:40:16,185 --> 00:40:18,552
He didn't even use
the word "sorry."

1110
00:40:18,587 --> 00:40:20,427
- I don't even think
he knows the word "sorry."

1111
00:40:20,456 --> 00:40:21,967
- Are you two finished?
- We're just getting started.

1112
00:40:21,991 --> 00:40:23,023
- Take a chair, Harvey.

1113
00:40:23,058 --> 00:40:25,036
- And pour us a couple
of drinks while you're at it.

1114
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,860
- If I'd known
this was gonna happen,

1115
00:40:26,896 --> 00:40:28,996
I wouldn't have said anything,
much less "I'm sorry."

1116
00:40:29,031 --> 00:40:31,331
- Ooh, look at that.
He does know the word.

1117
00:40:31,367 --> 00:40:34,401
- Yeah, just not how to use it.
- Mm-hmm.

1118
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:42,609
- Louis, where have you been
all day?

1119
00:40:44,814 --> 00:40:46,947
- I needed to spend some time
with Sheila.

1120
00:40:46,982 --> 00:40:48,782
- Well, I've got good news.

1121
00:40:48,818 --> 00:40:51,084
I found a midwife class
for you.

1122
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,253
Turns out, you're not the only
mid-aged white man

1123
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:55,989
that wants to be
Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.

1124
00:40:56,025 --> 00:40:57,958
- That's great.

1125
00:40:57,993 --> 00:41:00,461
But I'm gonna need you
to cancel it.

1126
00:41:00,496 --> 00:41:04,431
- Louis, what's wrong?

1127
00:41:04,467 --> 00:41:07,301
- It was a false positive.

1128
00:41:07,336 --> 00:41:08,535
We're not gonna have a baby.

1129
00:41:08,571 --> 00:41:10,671
- I'm so sorry.

1130
00:41:10,706 --> 00:41:11,850
But that doesn't mean
that she--

1131
00:41:11,874 --> 00:41:12,773
- I know that, Gretchen.

1132
00:41:12,808 --> 00:41:15,008
I just need a little time
to myself.

1133
00:41:15,044 --> 00:41:16,477
- Of course.

1134
00:41:18,214 --> 00:41:21,148
You don't have to be strong
for me, Louis.
