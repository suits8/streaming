1
00:00:00,013 --> 00:00:01,264
<i>Previously, on "Suits"...</i>

2
00:00:01,288 --> 00:00:02,922
Which one of my clients
are you after?

3
00:00:02,924 --> 00:00:05,358
Because we both know
you can't have Pfizer.

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,493
- Yes, I can.
- Then make me name partner.

5
00:00:06,495 --> 00:00:07,994
You don't just slap
somebody's name on the wall

6
00:00:07,996 --> 00:00:09,015
to get a client.

7
00:00:09,016 --> 00:00:10,864
I'm not just slapping
his name up, Louis.

8
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:12,465
I'm making a move.

9
00:00:12,467 --> 00:00:14,133
I'm not saying Donna doesn't
deserve a promotion;

10
00:00:14,135 --> 00:00:16,703
I'm just saying making partner
means something.

11
00:00:16,705 --> 00:00:18,705
And I'm concerned that being
one here

12
00:00:18,707 --> 00:00:20,740
won't mean what it used to.

13
00:00:20,742 --> 00:00:22,208
This is an amazing amount
of work.

14
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,910
I stayed up all night
doing it.

15
00:00:23,912 --> 00:00:25,645
But I thought you take the
night shift with your son.

16
00:00:25,647 --> 00:00:26,913
I told my wife she'd have
to take it last night.

17
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:28,581
I thought you might
need a little relief.

18
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,592
You sure?
Support his head.

19
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:32,233
There we go.

20
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:34,167
Holy shit. Gordon doesn't
really wanna take over.

21
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:35,535
He just wants
to orchestrate a deal

22
00:00:35,537 --> 00:00:36,803
where his guys come back,

23
00:00:36,805 --> 00:00:38,205
they vote to merge with Zane,

24
00:00:38,207 --> 00:00:39,740
and we cease to exist.

25
00:00:39,742 --> 00:00:41,008
I just found out
that my two partners

26
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,164
are willing to stab me
in the back.

27
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:45,098
God damn it, Louis.
I'm trying the best I can.

28
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,689
Well, then,
try something else,

29
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,720
because giving you the reins
a half hour

30
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:50,187
before we drive off
a cliff

31
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:52,056
isn't gonna do shit.

32
00:00:52,058 --> 00:00:54,992
I just came to make sure that
the paperwork was in order

33
00:00:54,994 --> 00:00:57,161
for your clients to come over
and join our new firm.

34
00:00:57,163 --> 00:00:59,163
I went and saw Andy Forsyth
today.

35
00:00:59,165 --> 00:01:01,632
You went to see him about us
moving to Seattle?

36
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:03,401
If we're ever gonna do

37
00:01:03,403 --> 00:01:04,802
something like this in our
lives, now is the time.

38
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:06,370
And what about the wedding?

39
00:01:06,372 --> 00:01:07,505
We could move it up.

40
00:01:07,507 --> 00:01:09,307
If I've learned one thing,

41
00:01:09,309 --> 00:01:10,741
it's that there is nothing
that I can't handle

42
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:12,443
when I have you by my side.

43
00:01:12,445 --> 00:01:14,245
You're the husband I've
always wanted.

44
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:16,647
And I can't wait to begin our
adventure together.

45
00:01:18,117 --> 00:01:19,150
Rachel and I were offered a
chance

46
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:20,785
to run a firm in
Seattle.

47
00:01:20,787 --> 00:01:22,353
- Mike--
- Harvey,

48
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:23,621
this is who I am.
It's who I've always been.

49
00:01:23,623 --> 00:01:25,423
It's time, Harvey.

50
00:01:31,464 --> 00:01:33,130
I'll tell you what, Robert.

51
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,954
Your baby girl
just got married,

52
00:01:34,955 --> 00:01:36,354
I'm gonna throw you a bone.

53
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:37,989
Your name goes first.

54
00:01:37,991 --> 00:01:39,691
No. No.

55
00:01:39,693 --> 00:01:41,334
You think I don't know
what you're doing.

56
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,669
Then I owe you.
Yours goes first.

57
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:44,937
You saying I owe you?

58
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,939
You do owe me.
I saved your ass.

59
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:48,640
Well, you only did
that because we put you

60
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:49,808
in a terrible position.

61
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:52,568
Wait.
That's against me.

62
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,238
Jesus Christ,
what have I got myself into?

63
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,873
I'll tell you what.

64
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,541
You got yourself
into Zane Specter Litt.

65
00:01:58,543 --> 00:02:01,144
Or Specter Zane Litt.

66
00:02:01,146 --> 00:02:03,780
Either way...

67
00:02:03,782 --> 00:02:07,083
Litt comes last.

68
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,523
Hey.

69
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:15,124
Wanna go out and get a burger?

70
00:02:15,126 --> 00:02:16,959
I do.
But it's 2:00 a.m.

71
00:02:16,961 --> 00:02:18,528
If I go out for
a burger right now,

72
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,029
the only thing
I'm getting is a divorce.

73
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:22,332
Copy that. I'll get you
one from the kitchen.

74
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:23,700
Yeah, meet me downstairs.

75
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:25,301
Hide it in the gift bag
or some shit.

76
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:04,500
- You're here early.
- I am.

77
00:03:04,502 --> 00:03:06,932
I know this is about the time
you finish your morning run.

78
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:08,365
Look, Harvey.
If this is about me

79
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:10,000
getting into it with Louis
while you were gone--

80
00:03:10,002 --> 00:03:11,602
It isn't. I didn't even know
that happened.

81
00:03:11,604 --> 00:03:13,838
Well, you might as well
hear about it now.

82
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,573
I came to him with an idea
to save the firm

83
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:17,827
that involved making me
temporary managing partner

84
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:19,595
and he bit my head off.

85
00:03:19,597 --> 00:03:21,263
Let me guess, he thought
you were coming after me.

86
00:03:21,265 --> 00:03:23,065
Harvey, I would never
do that to you.

87
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:24,733
I know that, but that's not
what I'm here to talk about.

88
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:27,703
I'm here to tell you
that as of this morning

89
00:03:27,705 --> 00:03:29,371
we're merging with Robert Zane.

90
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:31,001
- What?
- Alex.

91
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:32,475
I don't believe it.

92
00:03:32,476 --> 00:03:34,109
When I came over
you said my name

93
00:03:34,111 --> 00:03:35,344
would be the one to go up next.

94
00:03:35,346 --> 00:03:36,512
I know that,
but this was

95
00:03:36,514 --> 00:03:38,313
the only way
to save the firm.

96
00:03:38,315 --> 00:03:40,048
And you know
as well as I do,

97
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,450
Zane has been
a name partner

98
00:03:41,452 --> 00:03:43,418
longer than me and Louis
combined.

99
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,888
All right,
I get it.

100
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,422
But we had an agreement.

101
00:03:47,424 --> 00:03:49,691
And I want your word right now
that you're gonna honor it.

102
00:03:49,693 --> 00:03:52,794
You have my word.
Your name goes up next.

103
00:03:54,703 --> 00:03:56,569
All right.

104
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,471
One more thing.

105
00:03:58,473 --> 00:04:01,041
Did Louis know about
the merger before this morning?

106
00:04:01,043 --> 00:04:02,308
Yeah, why?

107
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,576
Because if he didn't tell
me about it,

108
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:05,412
he must really not trust me.

109
00:04:05,414 --> 00:04:08,148
Which means when it is time to
put my name up there--

110
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,116
- Louis'll be fine, Alex.
- And what if he's not?

111
00:04:10,118 --> 00:04:11,985
Like I said,
you have my word.

112
00:04:18,994 --> 00:04:20,694
Of course I would
do that for you.

113
00:04:20,696 --> 00:04:22,762
I would do anything for you
because I love you.

114
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:24,631
I promise.
I will never bring it up again.

115
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:26,666
We never have
to get a Maine Coon.

116
00:04:28,103 --> 00:04:29,869
- Sheila?
- Yes.

117
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:32,005
Anyway, I brought you in
because I want--

118
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:33,807
Katrina, what's on your mind?

119
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:37,510
Nothing.
It's just, giving up cats?

120
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:40,268
Louis, after all she put
you through, are you sure?

121
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,535
I am.
And besides,

122
00:04:41,537 --> 00:04:43,271
she's still open
to getting a short hair.

123
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,274
- Well, then I'm happy for you.
- And I'm happy for you, too,

124
00:04:46,276 --> 00:04:48,009
because today is the day
that you get to make

125
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:49,343
your two greatest loves
more efficient.

126
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:51,212
Don't tell me.
We're merging with Zane;

127
00:04:51,214 --> 00:04:52,313
we have more associates
than we can handle;

128
00:04:52,315 --> 00:04:54,292
and you need
the one person

129
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:56,627
who worked at both firms
to cull that herd.

130
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,362
Exactly.
And now I need you to come up

131
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,163
with a list of the ten
least-efficient associates

132
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:01,899
without telling me names
or whether or not

133
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,100
they come from Zane or us.

134
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,668
Got it.

135
00:05:04,824 --> 00:05:06,924
And, Katrina?

136
00:05:06,926 --> 00:05:09,427
Thanks for your concern
about Sheila and me.

137
00:05:09,429 --> 00:05:11,262
Louis, you know I care
for you

138
00:05:11,264 --> 00:05:13,297
deeply in
a completely asexual manner.

139
00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:14,832
And I too care
for you deeply

140
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:17,802
and see you neither
as man nor woman.

141
00:05:17,804 --> 00:05:19,670
Thank you, Louis.

142
00:05:19,672 --> 00:05:21,138
Kinder words were never spoken.

143
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,340
I'll have my list for you
by the end of the day.

144
00:05:31,984 --> 00:05:33,818
I'm gonna miss her too.

145
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:36,384
I'm not sure which is worse.

146
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:37,719
Finding out Mike was a fraud

147
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:40,021
or that he's taking
my daughter away.

148
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:43,625
Pretty sure it was
the fraud thing.

149
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:45,393
You probably got a point.

150
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:48,163
Speaking of frauds
and your daughter.

151
00:05:55,867 --> 00:05:57,600
She left that for me?

152
00:05:57,602 --> 00:06:00,036
A little welcome to the firm
from your little girl.

153
00:06:01,773 --> 00:06:02,972
By the way,
Harvey wants to meet

154
00:06:02,974 --> 00:06:04,307
at 9:30 in the conference room.

155
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:06,009
So in the meantime,
why don't you

156
00:06:06,011 --> 00:06:07,810
set yourself up
in Mike's old office.

157
00:06:08,246 --> 00:06:09,479
Thank you, Donna.

158
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:10,847
It's nice to have you here,
Robert.

159
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:13,216
Oh, we'll see how nice
it is once I tell Harvey

160
00:06:13,218 --> 00:06:15,818
it's not his old office
that I'm looking to be in.

161
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,388
Claiming managing partner
already.

162
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,822
Isn't that a bold statement
for day one?

163
00:06:19,824 --> 00:06:21,524
Let me tell you something,
Red.

164
00:06:21,526 --> 00:06:23,993
I've been making bold
statements my entire career.

165
00:06:23,995 --> 00:06:26,396
I'm sure as hell not
about to stop now.

All right,

who's gonna be
managing partner

179
00:07:07,914 --> 00:07:09,513
isn't something
we're gonna decide overnight.

180
00:07:09,515 --> 00:07:11,782
Therefore,
for the sake of firm harmony,

181
00:07:11,784 --> 00:07:13,951
I suggest we start
with conflicts of interest.

182
00:07:13,953 --> 00:07:15,786
- Fine with me.
- Me too.

183
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:17,722
Great.
As you can see,

184
00:07:17,724 --> 00:07:20,658
I've taken
the liberty of suggesting

185
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,360
who drops which client.

186
00:07:22,362 --> 00:07:25,196
And I am confident you'll agree
with all of my proposals

187
00:07:25,198 --> 00:07:27,498
with the exception--
- I'm not dropping Dexterol.

188
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,833
And I'm not
dropping Clavatin.

189
00:07:28,835 --> 00:07:30,368
- Exactly.
- Exactly what?

190
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,702
What do you mean,
"Exactly what?"

191
00:07:31,704 --> 00:07:33,471
I knew that neither of you
would be willing

192
00:07:33,473 --> 00:07:35,973
to give up those particular
clients. Exactly that.

193
00:07:36,494 --> 00:07:38,494
You mean you don't have
a suggestion?

194
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:39,796
I have a suggestion.

195
00:07:39,798 --> 00:07:41,097
You drop yours,
then the next time

196
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:42,965
we have a major conflict
I'll drop mine.

197
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:44,801
You sure about that?
Because the next major conflict

198
00:07:44,803 --> 00:07:46,736
we're gonna have is
who's managing partner.

199
00:07:46,738 --> 00:07:48,337
Then what exactly
is your idea?

200
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:49,772
I say whoever's
client billed

201
00:07:49,774 --> 00:07:51,274
the most hours
last year stays.

202
00:07:51,276 --> 00:07:52,575
Well, that's pretty damn
convenient

203
00:07:52,577 --> 00:07:54,911
because your client went
through a merger

204
00:07:54,913 --> 00:07:56,445
so their billables
are inflated.

205
00:07:56,447 --> 00:07:58,114
You're saying
that the sun got in your eyes

206
00:07:58,116 --> 00:07:59,348
and that's why you dropped
the big pass?

207
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,750
Wait a second,
Harvey's right.

208
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:02,351
- Come again?
- No, not about who to drop.

209
00:08:02,353 --> 00:08:04,153
Your client did just
go through a merger.

210
00:08:04,155 --> 00:08:05,755
They're in a whole new
line of business.

211
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:09,338
Most of which doesn't conflict
with Clavatin anymore.

212
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,740
Where you going with this?

213
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:12,308
I'm saying if we can get
either client

214
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,377
to drop the one division
where they still overlap

215
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:16,479
you can keep them both.

216
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:20,449
Well, in that case
I'll get my client to drop.

217
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:21,817
It's the least I can do.

218
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:23,553
Oh, no.
I'll do the honors.

219
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:25,454
After all, you welcomed me
into your home.

220
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:27,390
Why don't we make it
a friendly wager.

221
00:08:27,392 --> 00:08:28,991
We each get our client
to drop.

222
00:08:28,993 --> 00:08:30,393
First one who gets there wins.

223
00:08:30,395 --> 00:08:32,361
Sure thing.

224
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,389
Don't do it.

225
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:48,292
Don't do what?

226
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,527
Don't try to get Zane's
client to dump their division

227
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,462
after telling him you'd get
your client to do it.

228
00:08:52,464 --> 00:08:53,730
How do you even know
that's what happened?

229
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:55,299
I know because Louis told me.

230
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,633
What do you mean
Louis told you?

231
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:58,202
The meeting just ended two
seconds ago

232
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,436
and I came right back here.

233
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,271
In that case,
I mean,

234
00:09:01,273 --> 00:09:03,207
I heard Louis' voice
on the recording device

235
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,708
that I had installed
in the conference room.

236
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,210
You bugged the meeting?

237
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,544
Bugged is such
a distasteful word.

238
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:09,413
- That's not an answer.
- Okay.

239
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,348
You want an answer?

240
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,910
I have been listening
to your conversations

241
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:16,044
since you were an associate
and I'm not about to stop now.

242
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:17,412
Now, do you want to quibble
about my methods

243
00:09:17,414 --> 00:09:18,647
or do you want
to get the part

244
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:19,815
where I save you
from yourself?

245
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:21,450
- Donna.
- Harvey, you heard him.

246
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:23,285
Zane's got his eye on
managing partner.

247
00:09:23,287 --> 00:09:24,820
I know good
and well what he's after.

248
00:09:24,822 --> 00:09:26,555
Then why would you give
him ammunition?

249
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:29,658
Because you think
this is gonna be fun.

250
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,393
But trust me,
you go after him

251
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:33,261
and it's gonna get more serious
than you thought.

252
00:09:33,263 --> 00:09:34,863
And in the end,
you're just gonna prove

253
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,566
that he's better suited
to be in your office than you.

254
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,325
Okay, Donna.

255
00:09:42,927 --> 00:09:45,261
Okay, you're not gonna pick
a fight with Robert Zane?

256
00:09:45,263 --> 00:09:48,197
No. Okay, I'm gonna find
someone else to do it for me.

257
00:09:55,974 --> 00:09:57,540
Twice in one day.

258
00:09:57,542 --> 00:09:58,941
To what do I owe
the pleasure now?

259
00:09:58,943 --> 00:10:00,576
I'm here to tell you,
you want your name

260
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:01,777
on the door you got to earn it.

261
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:03,079
I thought I already had.

262
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:04,680
Maybe you have,
maybe you haven't,

263
00:10:04,682 --> 00:10:05,748
but I got something for you
to do anyway.

264
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,450
And what exactly is that?

265
00:10:07,452 --> 00:10:09,352
I need you to get
Robert Zane's biggest client

266
00:10:09,354 --> 00:10:11,287
to sell
their manufacturing division.

267
00:10:11,756 --> 00:10:13,823
Harvey,
you point me up the hill,

268
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:15,324
I'm gonna kill whoever's
at the top.

269
00:10:15,326 --> 00:10:17,126
- But?
- But in this case,

270
00:10:17,128 --> 00:10:18,427
the guy at
the top is on our side.

271
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:20,163
- Is he?
- What are you talking about?

272
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:22,330
I'm telling you
this is gonna determine

273
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,664
who runs the firm.

274
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,032
Zane knows it and I know it.

275
00:10:25,034 --> 00:10:26,867
So if you want me
to be able to live up

276
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:29,603
to that promise,
I need you to do this.

277
00:10:29,605 --> 00:10:30,971
And I don't like
being threatened

278
00:10:30,973 --> 00:10:32,673
for you to uphold
a promise you already made.

279
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:34,108
I don't either,
but like it or not,

280
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,377
this benefits both of us.

281
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:38,125
And I guarantee you right now,
Zane's going to

282
00:10:38,126 --> 00:10:40,159
his right-hand man
to ask the same thing.

283
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:41,694
And who is his right hand?

284
00:10:41,696 --> 00:10:43,863
Your job isn't
to ask who he is.

285
00:10:43,865 --> 00:10:46,065
Your job is to kick his ass.

286
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:16,845
You planning
on making it in

287
00:11:16,847 --> 00:11:18,981
to the new offices
anytime soon?

288
00:11:18,983 --> 00:11:20,749
What for?
Help you pick out new lamps?

289
00:11:20,751 --> 00:11:22,084
What's that supposed to mean?

290
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:23,919
It means I knew
you'd come in here

291
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:25,754
and ask me to take care of
whatever needs taking care of

292
00:11:25,756 --> 00:11:27,489
whenever it needs
taking care of.

293
00:11:27,491 --> 00:11:29,424
So unless you want to step in
and take a beating,

294
00:11:29,426 --> 00:11:30,826
why don't you just get to it?

295
00:11:30,828 --> 00:11:32,361
You think I couldn't
handle you?

296
00:11:32,363 --> 00:11:33,362
I think
if you took your tie off,

297
00:11:33,364 --> 00:11:35,263
we could find out.

298
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,346
Shit, I come up there
and get my ass kicked

299
00:11:37,348 --> 00:11:39,314
by a skinny white girl, my life
would never be the same.

300
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:41,650
So what do we got?
A number two, a number six?

301
00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:43,618
Number 14 with a side of 11.

302
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,087
Well, leave the file
and the particulars,

303
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:47,189
I'll get to it when I'm done.
- Samantha.

304
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:49,124
I need you to come
through for me on this one.

305
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,792
Come on, Robert, have I
ever let you down before?

306
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:51,994
You've never lost,

307
00:11:51,996 --> 00:11:54,563
but you have let me down
a time or two.

308
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:56,365
Well, then, I give you
my word this will not

309
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:58,633
be one of those times.

310
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:06,375
Damn, could kick my ass.

311
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,387
Katrina,
what are you doing here?

312
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:18,655
I gave you an assignment--
I finished it.

313
00:12:18,657 --> 00:12:19,890
What do you mean
you finished it?

314
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:21,558
I asked you to evaluate
50 associates.

315
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,826
How could you have done
that already?

316
00:12:22,828 --> 00:12:24,361
I didn't.
PATTIE did it for me.

317
00:12:24,363 --> 00:12:26,263
- Who the hell's Pattie?
- Not who, what.

318
00:12:26,265 --> 00:12:27,631
Personal
Assessment Tallying

319
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:29,132
and Totalling Individual
Efficiency.

320
00:12:29,134 --> 00:12:29,944
Say what now?

321
00:12:29,945 --> 00:12:32,387
I plugged in 16 parameters
and quantifiables,

322
00:12:32,388 --> 00:12:33,754
PATTIE popped out a list

323
00:12:33,756 --> 00:12:34,955
ranking the associates
from 1 to 50.

324
00:12:34,957 --> 00:12:36,323
Katrina, this is amazing.

325
00:12:36,325 --> 00:12:37,891
Not only that,
it's completely objective.

326
00:12:37,893 --> 00:12:39,960
The bottom ten are
the least efficient, period.

327
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:41,929
Well, then I guess
all that's left is for you

328
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:43,063
to tell me who they are
and for me to let them go.

329
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:44,498
About that, Louis.

330
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,166
I'd like to be the one
to do the letting go.

331
00:12:46,168 --> 00:12:48,202
Katrina, I could never ask
you to do that.

332
00:12:48,204 --> 00:12:49,937
You're not asking;
I am.

333
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:51,772
I don't understand.
Why would you want to?

334
00:12:51,774 --> 00:12:53,740
Louis, you told me I could be
senior partner one day.

335
00:12:53,742 --> 00:12:55,976
Which means, I need to be able
to do things like this.

336
00:12:55,978 --> 00:12:57,945
- But--
- And as Ned Stark would say,

337
00:12:57,947 --> 00:13:00,247
"He who passes the sentence
should swing the sword."

338
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:02,049
You know I can never argue
with Ned Stark.

339
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:03,717
I do.

340
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:06,053
Thank you.

341
00:13:06,055 --> 00:13:07,788
Katrina.

342
00:13:08,858 --> 00:13:11,758
Make them clean deaths.
- I will.

343
00:13:22,538 --> 00:13:24,304
Jeremy Stiller.

344
00:13:24,982 --> 00:13:27,016
- Who are you?
- I work for Robert Zane.

345
00:13:27,018 --> 00:13:29,118
Ah. Well, I'm sorry
Ms. Works for Robert Zane,

346
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,419
but this is private property.

347
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:31,987
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

348
00:13:31,989 --> 00:13:34,123
I have to say,
it almost feels like you knew

349
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,524
this encounter would happen.

350
00:13:35,526 --> 00:13:37,293
That's because
Alex Williams told me

351
00:13:37,295 --> 00:13:39,061
a man named Sam Wheeler
would be coming.

352
00:13:39,063 --> 00:13:40,896
Which means he was
resourceful enough

353
00:13:40,898 --> 00:13:42,464
to find out my name but
didn't have enough imagination

354
00:13:42,466 --> 00:13:43,933
to think I might be a woman.

355
00:13:43,935 --> 00:13:45,067
Well,
he had enough imagination

356
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:46,669
to tell me not
to take your call.

357
00:13:46,671 --> 00:13:47,970
And he only did that
because he's afraid

358
00:13:47,972 --> 00:13:49,171
you might like
what I have to say.

359
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:51,073
Well, I don't.
Even if I did,

360
00:13:51,075 --> 00:13:52,241
I'm loyal to Specter Litt.

361
00:13:52,243 --> 00:13:53,876
Look, I'm sorry.

362
00:13:53,878 --> 00:13:55,211
Clearly we got off
on the wrong foot, but I--

363
00:13:55,213 --> 00:13:56,612
We did.
Now if you don't mind,

364
00:13:56,614 --> 00:13:58,547
I have work to do.

365
00:14:02,564 --> 00:14:04,264
I grew up poor.

366
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:05,999
We lived on a farm
and my only chance

367
00:14:06,001 --> 00:14:07,701
of going to college
was to get a scholarship,

368
00:14:07,703 --> 00:14:09,703
which I did.

369
00:14:09,705 --> 00:14:12,472
Sophomore year, the company
that funded my scholarship

370
00:14:12,474 --> 00:14:14,207
went out of business.

371
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:16,142
So I had a choice.

372
00:14:16,144 --> 00:14:19,045
Do it myself,
or don't do it at all.

373
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:23,884
Since then,
I have scratched and clawed

374
00:14:23,886 --> 00:14:26,853
for everything I have ever had.

375
00:14:26,855 --> 00:14:28,255
Why are you telling me this?

376
00:14:28,257 --> 00:14:29,789
Because the details
were different

377
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,058
but I know the same thing
happened to you.

378
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:35,762
Please.

379
00:14:35,764 --> 00:14:38,365
All I'm asking
is for you to hear me out.

380
00:14:41,003 --> 00:14:42,636
Okay, I'll hear you out.

381
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,166
But there's no way
I'm dropping my business.

382
00:14:49,106 --> 00:14:50,405
Donna, do you have a minute?

383
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:51,906
Does this have to do
with the associates

384
00:14:51,908 --> 00:14:53,275
we're letting go?
- It does.

385
00:14:53,277 --> 00:14:54,643
And since I understand
you'll be doing

386
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:55,944
exit interviews with them,

387
00:14:55,946 --> 00:14:58,280
I thought you should know
who's going.

388
00:14:58,282 --> 00:14:59,948
That's funny.

389
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,583
That's not what I thought
you'd be asking.

390
00:15:01,585 --> 00:15:03,051
What do you mean?

391
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:04,953
Katrina, are you sure you're
going to be okay

392
00:15:04,955 --> 00:15:07,222
firing people you've worked
with for years?

393
00:15:07,224 --> 00:15:09,190
I mean, I know you value
you the firm, but this--

394
00:15:09,192 --> 00:15:11,026
I know it isn't going
to be easy, Donna.

395
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:13,480
I was once let go
from here too,

396
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:15,739
but I'll tell you
what I told Louis.

397
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,540
That if I'm going
to grow in my role here

398
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,408
this is something I'm going
to have to learn to do.

399
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,744
Fair enough.

400
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,413
Hang on a second,
has Louis seen this list?

401
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,948
No, why?

402
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,283
There's a problem with
the first name.

403
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:29,085
He's not gonna like it.
- I know that.

404
00:15:29,087 --> 00:15:30,886
Then I suggest
you let him know

405
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,054
before you pull the trigger.

406
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,256
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

407
00:15:34,258 --> 00:15:36,759
Because this process
is supposed to be impartial.

408
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:38,394
And if I tell Louis
who I'm going to fire

409
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,363
just because he won't like
one of the names on the list--

410
00:15:40,365 --> 00:15:42,331
What won't I like?

411
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,902
Louis, Katrina was
just informing me

412
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,419
that it's not
a good idea for you--

413
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,253
What name?

414
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:52,089
- Brian.
- Nope.

415
00:15:52,091 --> 00:15:53,256
- Louis.
- Donna, this is between

416
00:15:53,258 --> 00:15:54,358
Katrina and me.

417
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,559
No, Louis, it isn't.

418
00:15:55,561 --> 00:15:57,794
This is about the firm
and its integrity.

419
00:15:57,796 --> 00:15:59,529
You asked me to come up with
an objective metric

420
00:15:59,531 --> 00:16:02,032
and by that metric,
Brian Altman has to go.

421
00:16:02,034 --> 00:16:03,834
- So change the metric.
- I can't do that.

422
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:05,202
And even if I could
he'd be just as likely

423
00:16:05,204 --> 00:16:06,803
to go down as go up.

424
00:16:06,805 --> 00:16:08,311
I understand that,
but I don't give a shit.

425
00:16:08,312 --> 00:16:09,345
Anyone but Brian.
- Louis--

426
00:16:09,347 --> 00:16:10,579
Katrina, listen to me.

427
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:12,181
You asked for this
responsibility

428
00:16:12,183 --> 00:16:13,983
so I gave it to you.
So now I am telling you

429
00:16:13,985 --> 00:16:16,018
to find a way to keep him.

430
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:19,955
Okay, Louis.
I'll see what I can do.

431
00:16:26,783 --> 00:16:28,316
Harvey, we need to talk.

432
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:29,451
Don't tell me,
there's a problem.

433
00:16:29,453 --> 00:16:30,719
- There is.
- What is it now?

434
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:32,454
It's not
that big of a deal,

435
00:16:32,456 --> 00:16:33,755
but you're gonna have
to figure out what font to use

436
00:16:33,757 --> 00:16:35,357
to put my name
on the letterhead.

437
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:37,425
Because as of 2:00 p.m. today,
Robert Zane's client

438
00:16:37,427 --> 00:16:39,361
is officially dropping their
manufacturing division.

439
00:16:39,363 --> 00:16:40,662
You telling me you did it?

440
00:16:40,664 --> 00:16:42,163
Signed, sealed,
and delivered, my man.

441
00:16:42,165 --> 00:16:43,498
Now let's get down
to figuring out--

442
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,301
What?
How to counter my last move?

443
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:48,069
Because you may have
them signed and sealed

444
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:49,471
but I'm here to tell you
your delivery

445
00:16:49,473 --> 00:16:51,206
got lost on the way.

446
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,375
- Who the hell are you?
- Her name is Sam Wheeler.

447
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:55,230
Truth be told, Alex,
I prefer Samantha.

448
00:16:55,326 --> 00:16:56,692
You two know each other?

449
00:16:56,694 --> 00:16:58,394
No, but it doesn't
take a genius to figure

450
00:16:58,396 --> 00:16:59,929
out she's Zane's guy.
- He didn't figure it out.

451
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:02,398
What I figured out is,
whoever you are,

452
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,133
if you think you can waltz
into my office--

453
00:17:04,135 --> 00:17:05,568
- Harvey, I got it.
- Do you?

454
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,737
Because unless
I'm misreading the situation,

455
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:09,638
she's saying you don't.
- Harvey.

456
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,441
You know what, you two are
obviously having some trouble.

457
00:17:12,443 --> 00:17:14,243
The good news is
you'll have plenty of time

458
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:17,012
to work it out because
as of end of business today,

459
00:17:17,014 --> 00:17:20,049
your client is dropping
their manufacturing division.

460
00:17:20,051 --> 00:17:21,550
And we can get back
to the business of running

461
00:17:21,552 --> 00:17:24,353
this firm under
the direction of Robert Zane.

462
00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:27,556
You two have a nice--
You know I don't mean it.

463
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:32,987
No.

464
00:17:32,989 --> 00:17:34,956
- What do you mean, no?
- I mean this is my fight.

465
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,158
You asked me to fight it,
and I'm not gonna

466
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,493
let you step into
the middle of round two.

467
00:17:38,495 --> 00:17:40,128
It may be
the middle of round two,

468
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,263
but you just told me you got
a first round knock-out.

469
00:17:42,265 --> 00:17:44,332
Well, I was wrong.
But I'm still in the ring,

470
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:46,134
my partnership's on the line,
and I'm not getting out.

471
00:17:46,136 --> 00:17:49,137
- Then you better win.
- Where you going?

472
00:17:49,139 --> 00:17:52,240
To pick a fight
in my own weight class.

473
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,242
Robert, how are you?
Settling in all right?

474
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,211
Doing just fine,
thanks for asking.

475
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,579
What can I do for you?

476
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,348
I just dropped by
to tell you I had

477
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,216
an interesting conversation
with your girl, Sam.

478
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,619
She's kicking
your ass, isn't she?

479
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,253
Not mine.
Since neither of you

480
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,588
had the balls to invite
me into the ring.

481
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,357
Just like you
didn't invite me.

482
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,871
And don't give me any of this
nonsense about we had a deal.

483
00:18:15,872 --> 00:18:17,638
Because you broke it
just as fast as I did.

484
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,373
I did,
but my issue isn't

485
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,842
that she's fighting
your battles for you.

486
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:22,510
It's that she walked
into my office like

487
00:18:22,512 --> 00:18:24,612
I wasn't the managing partner
of this firm.

488
00:18:24,614 --> 00:18:26,280
And I didn't like
the way she introduced herself

489
00:18:26,282 --> 00:18:27,582
to me either.

490
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:29,517
But that's not
what your issue is.

491
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:31,018
You're pissed.

492
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,254
Because I didn't get in
the ring myself.

493
00:18:33,256 --> 00:18:35,122
Because if I'm not in there,
you're not in there.

494
00:18:35,124 --> 00:18:37,091
And you can't stand not
being in there.

495
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,093
Are you saying
I always have to shoot?

496
00:18:39,095 --> 00:18:40,595
Because I'm fine
passing the ball.

497
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:42,130
I'm talking about
being a coach.

498
00:18:42,132 --> 00:18:44,165
And if you were one,
you wouldn't mind

499
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:46,000
just sitting back and watching
Samantha Wheeler

500
00:18:46,002 --> 00:18:47,402
eat your boy for breakfast.

501
00:18:47,404 --> 00:18:48,569
And if you think
that's gonna happen,

502
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:50,171
you don't know Alex Williams.

503
00:18:50,173 --> 00:18:52,173
Oh, I know that's what's
gonna happen.

504
00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:54,509
And the person you don't know
is Harvey Specter.

505
00:18:54,511 --> 00:18:56,010
I know myself just fine.

506
00:18:56,012 --> 00:18:57,779
Then tell me you'll stay
the hell out of this.

507
00:18:57,781 --> 00:19:00,678
No problem, I just gave
Alex my word I'd stay out.

508
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:02,412
And what kind of
managing partner would I be

509
00:19:02,414 --> 00:19:03,613
if I couldn't live up
to my word.

510
00:19:03,615 --> 00:19:05,348
Because,
just so we're clear, Robert,

511
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,584
I am managing partner.
- Whatever you say, Harvey.

512
00:19:07,586 --> 00:19:09,615
But remember,
you didn't only

513
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,649
give your word
to Alex Williams anymore.

514
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,252
You just gave your word to me.

515
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,701
And the next thing I knew...

516
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:25,906
There were peas everywhere!

517
00:19:25,908 --> 00:19:30,110
On me, on the wall,
everywhere but in his mouth.

518
00:19:30,112 --> 00:19:32,746
I'm telling you, it was--
- Disgusting.

519
00:19:33,816 --> 00:19:35,883
I was gonna say adorable,
but...

520
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:38,953
Anyway, this is nice.

521
00:19:38,955 --> 00:19:40,888
Katrina, I'm glad
you suggested lunch.

522
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,457
So tell me, Brian.

523
00:19:43,459 --> 00:19:45,526
Do you think
that having a baby

524
00:19:45,528 --> 00:19:47,261
has made you more productive
in the workplace?

525
00:19:47,263 --> 00:19:49,363
- Are you kidding me?
- I see.

526
00:19:49,365 --> 00:19:51,298
Then what about
your efficiency?

527
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,701
I understand children
sometimes necessitate

528
00:19:53,703 --> 00:19:55,536
better time management skills.

529
00:19:55,537 --> 00:19:57,137
For my wife, maybe.
But to tell you the truth,

530
00:19:57,139 --> 00:19:58,639
I'm all over the place.

531
00:19:58,641 --> 00:19:59,773
Then what would
you say

532
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:01,541
are the areas
where you do excel?

533
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:04,411
- With my son?
- No, Brian. At work.

534
00:20:05,214 --> 00:20:06,580
Oh, my God.
Am I getting fired?

535
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:08,315
What?
No.

536
00:20:08,317 --> 00:20:10,117
We were just talking
about babies,

537
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,385
and it got me thinking--

538
00:20:11,387 --> 00:20:13,320
About my time management
skills?

539
00:20:13,742 --> 00:20:15,742
Katrina, don't lie to me.
I've heard the rumors.

540
00:20:15,744 --> 00:20:18,378
Am I one of the ones
being let go from the merger?

541
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,114
You heard right, Brian.
We are making some cuts.

542
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:23,149
But you should know
the decisions were based

543
00:20:23,151 --> 00:20:25,051
on completely objective data.

544
00:20:25,053 --> 00:20:26,286
Completely objective?

545
00:20:26,288 --> 00:20:27,687
I work my ass off
for this firm.

546
00:20:27,689 --> 00:20:29,534
Well, your numbers certainly
don't show that.

547
00:20:29,535 --> 00:20:31,168
- My numbers?
- Yes, your numbers.

548
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,669
The thing that indicates
how hard you work.

549
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:34,404
I don't believe this.

550
00:20:34,406 --> 00:20:36,373
You know what, maybe people
were right about you.

551
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:37,966
What does that mean?

552
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:39,500
It means they say
you're cold

553
00:20:39,502 --> 00:20:41,336
and all you care about
is your job.

554
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:43,838
Well, maybe they're right.
Maybe you are a robot.

555
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,473
How dare you say that to me.

556
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:47,241
How dare I say that to you?

557
00:20:47,243 --> 00:20:49,344
I've been showing you pictures
of my child

558
00:20:49,346 --> 00:20:51,512
and the whole time you've just
been waiting to fire me.

559
00:20:51,514 --> 00:20:53,114
What kind of person
would do that?

560
00:20:53,116 --> 00:20:55,383
You know what,
the kind of person

561
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:59,087
who's been trying to figure out
how to save your job.

562
00:20:59,472 --> 00:21:01,605
But I haven't heard one thing
that I can use

563
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:03,273
to justify keeping you.

564
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:06,610
So as far as I'm concerned,
you're fired.

565
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:14,788
Louis,
Can I talk to you for second?

566
00:21:15,321 --> 00:21:16,587
Course, what do you need?

567
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:17,821
I have something I want
to run by you.

568
00:21:17,823 --> 00:21:18,822
I need to know if you think
it'll work.

569
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:20,391
What's going on?

570
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:21,525
Harvey's trying
to get Zane's client

571
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:22,660
to drop their division,
not ours.

572
00:21:22,662 --> 00:21:24,228
And Zane's doing
the same thing.

573
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,696
Let me guess,
you're on team Harvey.

574
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:27,698
- Exactly.
- What's your plan?

575
00:21:40,213 --> 00:21:42,947
Well?

576
00:21:42,949 --> 00:21:44,281
I love it.

577
00:21:44,283 --> 00:21:45,983
You don't think there's an
end around for her

578
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:47,318
with an injunction?
- The only way she could do

579
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,686
that if she filed
an ex-parte motion.

580
00:21:48,688 --> 00:21:49,620
Which she can't do
retroactively.

581
00:21:49,622 --> 00:21:51,322
Alex, this is brilliant.

582
00:21:51,324 --> 00:21:53,891
Do you need help filing it?
- No, Louis. I already did.

583
00:21:53,893 --> 00:21:56,827
I was checking to make sure
I didn't miss anything.

584
00:21:56,829 --> 00:21:58,629
Hey, Alex.

585
00:21:58,631 --> 00:22:00,831
Harvey told me that you thought
I was still mad at you

586
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,700
because I didn't come
to you about Zane.

587
00:22:02,702 --> 00:22:04,702
That's not true.
As far as I'm concerned,

588
00:22:04,704 --> 00:22:06,704
you are on our side.
You always will be.

589
00:22:06,706 --> 00:22:09,940
When the time comes,
I'll back you as name partner.

590
00:22:09,942 --> 00:22:12,343
I appreciate that, Louis.

591
00:22:12,345 --> 00:22:14,311
Go get 'em.

592
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:24,488
Hey, Brian, I was just
about to come--

593
00:22:24,489 --> 00:22:26,823
- See me? Bullshit.
- What do you mean bullshit?

594
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:29,325
I mean there's no way you
were gonna come see me

595
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:30,660
because you didn't even
have the balls

596
00:22:30,662 --> 00:22:31,995
to fire me
to my face.

597
00:22:31,997 --> 00:22:33,296
What?
Brian, nobody's firing you.

598
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:34,631
You're gonna look me
in the eye

599
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:36,900
and tell me that Katrina
didn't run her numbers

600
00:22:36,902 --> 00:22:39,602
and determine that I don't work
hard enough to serve this firm?

601
00:22:39,604 --> 00:22:40,904
- No, that's not--
- You know what?

602
00:22:40,906 --> 00:22:42,639
If you'd at least come
and told me yourself,

603
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:44,507
but why should I expect
something like that?

604
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:46,743
After all, it's not like you
ever held my newborn son.

605
00:22:46,745 --> 00:22:49,179
Brian, please wait.

606
00:22:50,348 --> 00:22:53,149
I told Katrina to find
a way to keep you

607
00:22:53,151 --> 00:22:55,285
because I believe
that you

608
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:56,953
are more than worthy
of serving this firm.

609
00:22:56,955 --> 00:23:00,211
And I do care about you
and that is the truth.

610
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,078
Yeah, well, maybe you did
tell her all that,

611
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,013
but it didn't stop her
from firing me anyway.

612
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,648
- Brian--
- You know what, Louis?

613
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,816
If you need me, I'll be
spending the next two days

614
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,485
getting my files in order.

615
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,720
Because contrary
to Katrina's analysis,

616
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,790
I care about my clients,
and I'm a damn good lawyer.

617
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:26,191
Louis, before you say--

618
00:23:26,193 --> 00:23:28,060
What the fuck is
your problem?

619
00:23:28,062 --> 00:23:30,362
I gave you an order
and you blatantly ignored me.

620
00:23:30,364 --> 00:23:31,563
I didn't ignore you.

621
00:23:31,565 --> 00:23:33,198
Then what do
you call firing Brian

622
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,833
when I specifically
told you not to?

623
00:23:34,835 --> 00:23:37,069
Listen to me,
I tried not to fire him.

624
00:23:37,071 --> 00:23:39,671
I took him to lunch, and we--
- Oh, good, lunch.

625
00:23:39,673 --> 00:23:40,939
I hope the chicken potpie
was delicious.

626
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:42,207
You still didn't do
what I asked.

627
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:43,709
You know what?

628
00:23:43,711 --> 00:23:45,677
I did do what
you originally asked.

629
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,946
To objectively evaluate
the associates.

630
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:49,581
Not coddle your teacher's pet.

631
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:50,816
Screw what
I originally asked.

632
00:23:50,818 --> 00:23:52,451
I told you to rejigger
the metrics

633
00:23:52,453 --> 00:23:54,486
to keep a valued associate.

634
00:23:54,488 --> 00:23:56,054
You think fudging the numbers
wasn't the first thing I tried?

635
00:23:56,056 --> 00:23:57,723
It didn't work.

636
00:23:57,725 --> 00:24:00,258
He always came out too low.
- I don't care.

637
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,260
Well, I do.
Because I care about this firm.

638
00:24:02,262 --> 00:24:04,396
And what kind of message does
rejiggering the metrics

639
00:24:04,398 --> 00:24:07,232
send to the associates
who work 100 hours a week,

640
00:24:07,234 --> 00:24:09,301
who eat dinner here every
night,

641
00:24:09,303 --> 00:24:12,537
who don't even go on dates,
let alone have a baby.

642
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:15,215
I don't care what message
it sends, Katrina.

643
00:24:15,216 --> 00:24:17,183
Brian is staying.

644
00:24:17,185 --> 00:24:19,218
Then you figure out
who goes instead.

645
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,120
Because I'm not doing something
I don't believe in.

646
00:24:21,122 --> 00:24:24,624
No, Katrina. I told you once
and I'm telling you again.

647
00:24:24,626 --> 00:24:27,560
You asked for this job;
you are doing it.

648
00:24:40,628 --> 00:24:42,027
Harvey.

649
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:43,295
You need to take
a look at this.

650
00:24:43,297 --> 00:24:44,830
- What is it?
- It just came in.

651
00:24:44,832 --> 00:24:46,965
It's a proposed contract
of sale for Clavatin's--

652
00:24:46,967 --> 00:24:49,168
Manufacturing division.
Son of a bitch.

653
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,869
I need to find out where

654
00:24:50,871 --> 00:24:52,504
Judge Thomas is and I
need to find out now.

655
00:24:52,506 --> 00:24:54,640
Harvey, you can't do this
without Alex. It's his case.

656
00:24:54,642 --> 00:24:55,874
Then why the hell are you

657
00:24:55,876 --> 00:24:57,342
the one telling me this
and not him?

658
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,677
Because he's probably out
there fighting

659
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:00,312
because he thinks
he can still win.

660
00:25:00,313 --> 00:25:01,880
Well,
he's got one thing right.

661
00:25:01,882 --> 00:25:03,748
We can still win.
But he can't.

662
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,750
And if you cut him out,
you won't win either.

663
00:25:05,752 --> 00:25:07,152
You think I can't take
Samantha Wheeler?

664
00:25:07,154 --> 00:25:08,853
I think you said
you'd stay out of it.

665
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:11,489
And if you take over now
without even telling Alex,

666
00:25:11,491 --> 00:25:13,691
then you can find out where
Judge Thomas is yourself.

667
00:25:13,852 --> 00:25:15,852
Because I'm not gonna help you
tell your own team

668
00:25:15,854 --> 00:25:16,987
that you'll cut them
out just to get

669
00:25:16,989 --> 00:25:18,488
the better of Samantha Wheeler.

670
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,457
Look, you want
to tell Alex what I'm doing?

671
00:25:20,459 --> 00:25:22,893
Go ahead. I am not
about to sit on the sidelines

672
00:25:22,895 --> 00:25:24,895
and watch us lose.

673
00:25:27,285 --> 00:25:29,385
Harvey.

674
00:25:31,022 --> 00:25:33,555
I'm only gonna ask
you this once.

675
00:25:35,126 --> 00:25:36,692
Is there a chance you're
that overreacting

676
00:25:36,694 --> 00:25:38,661
to Mike having just left?

677
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:39,995
I don't know, Donna.

678
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,564
But to tell you the truth,
I don't care.

679
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,468
Okay.

680
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,671
You win.

681
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,907
I'll find out
where Judge Thomas is.

682
00:26:01,115 --> 00:26:03,610
Heavy is the head.

683
00:26:03,652 --> 00:26:06,786
Especially when what has
to be done is unjust.

684
00:26:06,788 --> 00:26:07,954
You still don't
think that Brian

685
00:26:07,956 --> 00:26:09,155
deserves to stay, do you?

686
00:26:09,157 --> 00:26:10,657
No, I don't.

687
00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:12,191
And when I told Louis
that it would send

688
00:26:12,193 --> 00:26:14,300
the wrong kind of message
to the people who work

689
00:26:14,301 --> 00:26:18,169
their asses off for this firm
a lot more than Brian,

690
00:26:18,171 --> 00:26:19,905
he said he didn't give a shit.

691
00:26:19,907 --> 00:26:21,973
I see.

692
00:26:21,975 --> 00:26:23,808
And what Louis
didn't understand was

693
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,144
that the people you're talking
about weren't just people.

694
00:26:26,146 --> 00:26:28,780
It was you.
- How could you--

695
00:26:28,782 --> 00:26:30,715
Because I know what
it's like to give everything

696
00:26:30,717 --> 00:26:32,083
and still be taken for granted.

697
00:26:32,085 --> 00:26:33,785
And for what it's worth,
I think Louis

698
00:26:33,787 --> 00:26:36,521
was wrong to say what he did.

699
00:26:36,793 --> 00:26:39,194
But he isn't wrong about Brian.

700
00:26:39,196 --> 00:26:41,296
- Well, I don't agree.
- I understand that.

701
00:26:41,298 --> 00:26:43,298
Probably has something to do
with why you told Harvey

702
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,133
that I shouldn't
be made partner last year.

703
00:26:45,135 --> 00:26:47,602
- You knew about that?
- I do now.

704
00:26:48,538 --> 00:26:49,904
- Donna, it wasn't--
- Tell me.

705
00:26:49,906 --> 00:26:51,639
You ran all the numbers
for Louis,

706
00:26:51,641 --> 00:26:53,875
who are the top five most
efficient associates?

707
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:58,947
Jesse, Sarah, Ryan, Carl,
and Gina.

708
00:26:58,949 --> 00:27:01,560
- Where does Brian sit?
- Right here.

709
00:27:01,565 --> 00:27:04,352
Right here in the center of
those five people?

710
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,024
Do you think
that's a coincidence?

711
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,626
- I had--
- Katrina.

712
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,228
What you have yet to learn
is that there are players

713
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,930
who never put up great stats,
but you keep them

714
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:17,334
around because they make
the people around them better.

715
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,869
Are you talking about Brian
or you?

716
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:22,172
I'm talking about both.

717
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:23,907
So what do I do?

718
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:25,342
You do what
you said you'd do.

719
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:28,011
You evaluate the associates.

720
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:31,314
Only this time, do it better.

721
00:27:33,613 --> 00:27:35,680
I'm sorry, Donna.

722
00:27:38,351 --> 00:27:40,251
I shouldn't have gone
to Harvey.

723
00:27:40,253 --> 00:27:42,420
It's okay, Katrina.

724
00:27:42,422 --> 00:27:45,290
COO is where I'm meant to be.

725
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,547
- Harvey.
- Alex,

726
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:54,349
before you say anything--
- No, you gave me your word

727
00:27:54,351 --> 00:27:56,117
that you were gonna
stay out of this.

728
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:57,252
The next thing I know,
you're having a meeting

729
00:27:57,254 --> 00:27:59,020
about my client without me.

730
00:27:59,022 --> 00:28:00,488
- First of all, it's my client.
- And it's my case.

731
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,023
Which you were about to lose.

732
00:28:02,025 --> 00:28:03,691
- It was a setback.
- Bullshit.

733
00:28:03,693 --> 00:28:05,293
You were getting
your ass kicked.

734
00:28:05,295 --> 00:28:06,928
And don't tell me you weren't.
- God damn it, Harvey.

735
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,030
Listen to me, Alex.
This woman is no joke.

736
00:28:09,032 --> 00:28:10,765
You saying I am?

737
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:13,167
I'm saying I just met with
Judge Thomas,

738
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:15,903
so I know exactly what
it's gonna take to beat her.

739
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,795
So the hell what? I can play
dirty just as well as you.

740
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,329
Maybe you can,
but I gave you a promise

741
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,064
to put your name on the wall.

742
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:24,667
And if you play dirty to beat
Robert Zane's right hand,

743
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,602
it isn't gonna happen.
- You know what I think?

744
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,204
That sounds like some bullshit
by a guy

745
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,611
who's just gonna do what
he wants like he always does.

746
00:28:30,612 --> 00:28:34,047
What I want, Alex,
is to stay managing partner.

747
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:35,415
This is the way
that's gonna happen.

748
00:28:35,417 --> 00:28:36,883
- Harvey, I--
- That's enough.

749
00:28:36,885 --> 00:28:38,985
I'm taking it from here.

750
00:28:38,987 --> 00:28:40,486
It's done.

751
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:55,206
Katrina, I've got a lot
on my plate this morning.

752
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:56,707
So if you don't mind--

753
00:28:56,709 --> 00:28:58,943
You just want your morning
coffee, I know.

754
00:28:59,812 --> 00:29:01,946
Was that part of
your efficiency evaluations?

755
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:04,115
People's coffee consumption?

756
00:29:04,306 --> 00:29:07,207
Look, Brian,
I was wrong about you.

757
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:09,142
I understand what you do
for the firm

758
00:29:09,144 --> 00:29:11,644
and I'm sorry for
the things I said.

759
00:29:11,646 --> 00:29:14,647
Well, I appreciate that,
but if you're just saying this

760
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:17,050
because Louis told you to--
- No, I'm not.

761
00:29:17,052 --> 00:29:19,586
And he didn't.

762
00:29:20,622 --> 00:29:22,555
Then why are you saying it?

763
00:29:22,557 --> 00:29:24,157
Because I took
this assignment hoping

764
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,758
that it would help me grow.

765
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,127
And if I can't ask for help
when I need it,

766
00:29:28,129 --> 00:29:30,830
then I have even more growing
to do than I thought.

767
00:29:30,832 --> 00:29:32,532
What do you mean ask
for help?

768
00:29:32,534 --> 00:29:34,667
My evaluation
of the associates was flawed.

769
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:37,971
It didn't take into
account intangibles, and...

770
00:29:37,973 --> 00:29:39,872
I was hoping you could help
me fix that.

771
00:29:39,874 --> 00:29:41,608
You mean you want me
to help you figure out

772
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,443
who to fire instead of me.

773
00:29:43,445 --> 00:29:44,744
No, Brian,
that's not what I meant.

774
00:29:44,746 --> 00:29:46,312
Yes, it is.
And I'm sure firing

775
00:29:46,314 --> 00:29:48,314
my fellow associates is
a value to the firm,

776
00:29:48,316 --> 00:29:49,849
but I'm not gonna help you
do it.

777
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,317
- What the hell did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

778
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:03,653
Well, except for
the thing that I did.

779
00:30:03,655 --> 00:30:04,887
You mean going
to Judge Thomas

780
00:30:04,889 --> 00:30:06,989
and having him allow
fabricated testimony

781
00:30:06,991 --> 00:30:08,724
to overrule my motion.

782
00:30:08,726 --> 00:30:11,561
It wasn't fabricated, but
it sure as hell was allowed.

783
00:30:11,563 --> 00:30:12,929
And how exactly did you get
him to do that?

784
00:30:12,931 --> 00:30:15,531
You know how I did it,
or you don't.

785
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:17,533
And if you don't,
well, I'm not about

786
00:30:17,535 --> 00:30:19,020
to open up my playbook
and show you.

787
00:30:19,021 --> 00:30:20,721
Well, Mr. Slick,
I don't give a shit

788
00:30:20,723 --> 00:30:22,422
how you did it.
I'm going to undo it

789
00:30:22,424 --> 00:30:23,905
because this is isn't over.

790
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,572
- Yes, it is.
- We'll see about that.

791
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:26,907
No, we won't.

792
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,709
Because I'm giving you
a direct order.

793
00:30:28,711 --> 00:30:30,511
You are not to take
any action

794
00:30:30,513 --> 00:30:32,546
to affect the outcome
of this situation.

795
00:30:32,548 --> 00:30:34,581
And you can give me all
the orders you want.

796
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,484
The only person I answer to
is Robert Zane.

797
00:30:37,486 --> 00:30:39,553
So if you want to stop
what I'm about to do,

798
00:30:39,555 --> 00:30:42,523
you better talk to him
before I god damn do it.

799
00:30:42,525 --> 00:30:45,859
- Don't you walk away from me.
- Kiss my ass.

800
00:30:49,953 --> 00:30:51,953
All right, Robert.
I have been patient,

801
00:30:51,955 --> 00:30:53,321
but it's over,
and I've won.

802
00:30:53,323 --> 00:30:54,855
Call off the dogs.

803
00:30:54,857 --> 00:30:56,457
What the hell
did you just say to me?

804
00:30:56,459 --> 00:30:58,426
I said call off the dogs.
I'm not gonna have someone

805
00:30:58,428 --> 00:31:00,795
inside my own firm who
doesn't know when she's lost.

806
00:31:00,797 --> 00:31:02,263
The only one in here
who doesn't know

807
00:31:02,265 --> 00:31:03,764
that they've lost is you.

808
00:31:03,766 --> 00:31:05,433
I didn't lose shit.

809
00:31:05,435 --> 00:31:07,368
And if you think I might,
why don't you pick up the phone

810
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,836
and call
Judge Thomas right now?

811
00:31:08,838 --> 00:31:10,171
I'm not talking about
Judge Thomas.

812
00:31:10,173 --> 00:31:11,839
Then what the hell
are you talking about?

813
00:31:11,841 --> 00:31:13,207
I'm talking about the fact
that you stood right here

814
00:31:13,209 --> 00:31:15,042
and gave your word
that you would stay

815
00:31:15,044 --> 00:31:17,011
out of this thing.
And not only did you break it,

816
00:31:17,013 --> 00:31:19,013
now you're in here trying
to drag me into it.

817
00:31:20,406 --> 00:31:22,440
Nothing to say?
That's right.

818
00:31:22,442 --> 00:31:24,842
You may have won the battle,
but you lost the goddamn war.

819
00:31:24,844 --> 00:31:26,811
Because you just showed
this entire firm

820
00:31:26,813 --> 00:31:28,846
only one of us is
managing partner material.

821
00:31:28,848 --> 00:31:31,182
And it isn't you.

822
00:31:31,184 --> 00:31:32,783
This is my firm,

823
00:31:32,785 --> 00:31:34,318
and I'm not gonna
let you take it.

824
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,054
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, Harvey.

825
00:31:37,056 --> 00:31:39,657
I already have.

826
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:41,726
Now, why don't you let
that rattle around

827
00:31:41,728 --> 00:31:43,160
for a little while,
and then come back

828
00:31:43,162 --> 00:31:45,162
when you're ready
to tell me that I'm right.

829
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,674
You can come in, you know.

830
00:32:00,676 --> 00:32:02,643
- Sorry, I didn't mean to--
- Yes, you did.

831
00:32:02,645 --> 00:32:03,778
You just wanted
to let me finish

832
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,379
whatever I was
in the middle of.

833
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,281
Not bad.

834
00:32:07,283 --> 00:32:08,616
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

835
00:32:08,618 --> 00:32:09,850
No, I mean, thanks

836
00:32:09,852 --> 00:32:11,419
for sticking up
for me with Katrina.

837
00:32:11,421 --> 00:32:13,554
- You figured it out.
- I did.

838
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,124
I was right about you.

839
00:32:17,126 --> 00:32:18,325
Aren't you right
about everybody?

840
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:20,227
Yeah, pretty much.

841
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:23,063
And now I have something else
to be right about.

842
00:32:24,801 --> 00:32:26,634
Katrina needs your help.

843
00:32:26,636 --> 00:32:28,302
Maybe she does,
but if I'd thought

844
00:32:28,304 --> 00:32:30,037
about the fact
that me staying would mean

845
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:32,907
someone I care about might
get fired...

846
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,675
I wouldn't have gone to Louis
in the first place.

847
00:32:34,677 --> 00:32:36,644
And that, right there,
is the reason we were right

848
00:32:36,646 --> 00:32:39,480
to keep you.
And as I see it...

849
00:32:39,482 --> 00:32:41,782
You can either help Katrina
make the right decision,

850
00:32:41,784 --> 00:32:44,885
or live with the fact that
she might make the wrong one.

851
00:32:44,887 --> 00:32:47,488
Like she almost did with you.

852
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:04,372
Harvey,
what can I do for you?

853
00:33:04,374 --> 00:33:06,107
I'll tell you what
you should have done for me.

854
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,109
Stop me from taking
the case from Alex.

855
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,710
And if you recall,
that's what I tried to do.

856
00:33:09,712 --> 00:33:11,045
And then
you changed your mind.

857
00:33:11,047 --> 00:33:12,313
Because I listened to you.

858
00:33:12,315 --> 00:33:13,614
Oh, well,
you picked a hell of a time

859
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,550
to start doing that
because Zane set me up.

860
00:33:15,552 --> 00:33:17,218
I don't care what Zane did,

861
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,619
you went after her
because it's who you are.

862
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,955
And you're supposed to be
saving me from myself.

863
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,356
Which is exactly what I did.

864
00:33:22,358 --> 00:33:23,458
How the hell
do you figure that?

865
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,293
Harvey, Mike left.

866
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:27,116
What does that have to do
with this?

867
00:33:27,118 --> 00:33:28,417
It has everything
to do with is.

868
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:30,052
Because the reason
he left is because

869
00:33:30,054 --> 00:33:33,222
he finally came to terms
with who he is.

870
00:33:33,224 --> 00:33:34,923
And now that he's gone,

871
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:37,659
who you are is a man
who wants back in the game.

872
00:33:37,661 --> 00:33:40,562
Don't you see, you've been
to the top of the mountain.

873
00:33:40,564 --> 00:33:42,331
You've proved you can
do it, and you may not

874
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:45,200
want to admit it, but...

875
00:33:45,202 --> 00:33:46,835
you're getting tired
of just sitting up there,

876
00:33:46,837 --> 00:33:49,271
enjoying the view.

877
00:33:49,273 --> 00:33:50,806
Donna,
how's it gonna look

878
00:33:50,808 --> 00:33:52,875
to the rest of the world
if I step down?

879
00:33:52,877 --> 00:33:54,743
I'll tell you how.

880
00:33:54,745 --> 00:33:56,645
Like no other firm
can touch us.

881
00:33:56,647 --> 00:33:58,914
Not with you and Robert
doing what everybody knows

882
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:01,717
you were meant to do.

883
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:04,486
And by that...

884
00:34:04,488 --> 00:34:05,654
I mean pulling off
the kind of shit

885
00:34:05,656 --> 00:34:07,990
that only Harvey Specter
can do.

886
00:34:20,471 --> 00:34:21,905
Katrina.

887
00:34:21,907 --> 00:34:23,740
You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

888
00:34:23,742 --> 00:34:25,475
Bridget, please sit down.

889
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:36,090
Am I getting fired?

890
00:34:36,092 --> 00:34:38,626
Yes.
I'm afraid you are.

891
00:34:38,628 --> 00:34:40,428
Katrina,
I know we merged,

892
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,897
but I have
a ton of student debt.

893
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:48,169
My landlord just raised my
rent, and...

894
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:50,671
I promised to pay for
my nephew's daycare

895
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:53,774
so my sister could go back
to school.

896
00:34:53,776 --> 00:34:56,043
Please.

897
00:34:56,045 --> 00:34:57,645
There's got
to be something I can do

898
00:34:57,647 --> 00:35:00,014
to get a second chance.

899
00:35:03,286 --> 00:35:05,119
I'm sorry,
Bridget,

900
00:35:05,121 --> 00:35:07,922
but the decision's
already been made.

901
00:35:09,292 --> 00:35:11,492
I do wish you the best of luck.

902
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:36,818
You know, life was simpler
when this was my office.

903
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,020
As I understand,
when you were in this office

904
00:35:39,022 --> 00:35:41,923
you almost went to
prison for Mike Ross.

905
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,794
I don't see what
was simpler about that.

906
00:35:46,165 --> 00:35:47,998
Yeah, you do.

907
00:35:49,568 --> 00:35:51,535
Robert, you said
that I should come back

908
00:35:51,537 --> 00:35:53,971
when I was ready to admit
that you were right.

909
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,708
Well, I'm back.

910
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:01,545
Takes a big man
to admit that, Harvey.

911
00:36:01,547 --> 00:36:03,614
I appreciate it.

912
00:36:03,616 --> 00:36:05,582
You're not gonna try
to hug me, are you?

913
00:36:05,584 --> 00:36:07,117
I don't know what goes on
between you and Louis,

914
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,752
but I'll pass.

915
00:36:10,222 --> 00:36:12,523
Then I guess this is
the part where I make

916
00:36:12,525 --> 00:36:15,702
my first humble request
to my fearless leader.

917
00:36:15,703 --> 00:36:19,171
That took about two seconds.

918
00:36:19,173 --> 00:36:21,173
Let's hear it.

919
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:23,175
My office.

920
00:36:23,711 --> 00:36:27,012
- What about it?
- I want it back.

921
00:36:28,582 --> 00:36:31,016
In that case,
your fearless leader

922
00:36:31,018 --> 00:36:33,218
is happy to comply.

923
00:36:40,361 --> 00:36:42,261
What do you say we go out
and grab those burgers?

924
00:36:42,263 --> 00:36:44,229
Not tonight, but we will.

925
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,755
I still have something I have
to take care of.

926
00:36:58,734 --> 00:37:01,534
- You were right.
- About what?

927
00:37:01,536 --> 00:37:04,271
It wasn't easy firing
those people.

928
00:37:04,273 --> 00:37:07,474
- So it's done?
- It's done.

929
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:10,010
You mind if I ask
if Brian ended up

930
00:37:10,012 --> 00:37:11,511
helping with this list?

931
00:37:11,513 --> 00:37:12,779
He did.

932
00:37:12,781 --> 00:37:15,382
And you were right
about him too.

933
00:37:15,384 --> 00:37:18,618
Well, as long as we're
handing out "You were rights,"

934
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:21,922
You were right about being
the one to let those people go.

935
00:37:21,924 --> 00:37:23,857
You mean it's good for
my growth.

936
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:26,927
No, I mean, I'm glad I didn't
have to do it. It sucks.

937
00:37:30,106 --> 00:37:32,873
Hey, you want to grab
a drink or something?

938
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,876
- I'd love to.
- Katrina.

939
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,645
Robert.

940
00:37:37,647 --> 00:37:39,513
Give me a second with
Red here, will you?

941
00:37:39,515 --> 00:37:42,450
Of course.
I'll be in my office.

942
00:37:42,452 --> 00:37:44,685
Am I in trouble?

943
00:37:44,687 --> 00:37:46,554
Why,
you do something wrong?

944
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,457
I guess that depends on what
you mean by wrong.

945
00:37:49,459 --> 00:37:51,592
I'm not here
because you're in trouble.

946
00:37:51,594 --> 00:37:54,795
I'm here because Harvey
just asked me to swap offices

947
00:37:54,797 --> 00:37:57,731
and then he told I was right.

948
00:37:59,064 --> 00:38:00,797
And I doubt those words
have ever come out

949
00:38:00,799 --> 00:38:02,232
of that man's mouth
without first having

950
00:38:02,234 --> 00:38:04,501
a conversation with you.

951
00:38:04,503 --> 00:38:05,769
You sound pretty sure
of yourself for a man

952
00:38:05,771 --> 00:38:07,137
who's only been here
about ten minutes.

953
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:08,672
You think Rachel
didn't tell her father

954
00:38:08,674 --> 00:38:10,607
about the mighty Donna Paulsen?

955
00:38:11,877 --> 00:38:15,045
Guess I never thought of her
as much of a chatterbox.

956
00:38:16,282 --> 00:38:18,415
Then again, she did tell me
about the time that you took--

957
00:38:18,417 --> 00:38:20,517
Whatever it is.
Just remember,

958
00:38:21,168 --> 00:38:22,568
once you say it out loud,

959
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,336
we can never pretend
that you don't know it.

960
00:38:24,338 --> 00:38:26,471
And that,
Robert Lucas Zane,

961
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:28,941
is why
you are managing partner.

962
00:38:30,377 --> 00:38:33,779
- Good night, Donna.
- Good night, Robert.

963
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:41,987
You really have no concept
of boundaries, do you?

964
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:44,056
You know,
most people would be here

965
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:46,058
to tell you they think
we got off on the wrong foot.

966
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,294
But I'm here to say
we got off on the right one,

967
00:38:49,296 --> 00:38:50,762
And what foot is that?

968
00:38:50,764 --> 00:38:52,264
The one where you
and I discover

969
00:38:52,266 --> 00:38:53,532
we're not
so different after all.

970
00:38:53,534 --> 00:38:54,866
I don't think
I'm anything like you.

971
00:38:54,868 --> 00:38:56,468
You are.
Right down to the fact

972
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,837
that we both grew up in
Riverside, New York.

973
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,139
Which is why we'll both
always feel like outsiders

974
00:39:01,141 --> 00:39:03,141
no matter how much we earn
their respect.

975
00:39:03,143 --> 00:39:05,096
How do you know
that about me?

976
00:39:05,097 --> 00:39:07,197
Because I do my homework.

977
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:10,901
Maybe we are alike.

978
00:39:10,903 --> 00:39:12,436
That's all I wanted to say.

979
00:39:12,438 --> 00:39:13,904
Except for one thing.

980
00:39:13,906 --> 00:39:16,507
You told Jeremy Stiller
that you grew up on a farm,

981
00:39:16,509 --> 00:39:19,610
and last I checked there aren't
any farms in Riverside.

982
00:39:19,612 --> 00:39:22,674
And that little observation
is the reason

983
00:39:22,675 --> 00:39:24,058
we got off on the right foot.

984
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:25,659
I don't follow.

985
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:27,060
There are three things
that happen

986
00:39:27,062 --> 00:39:28,862
when I tell different people
different stories.

987
00:39:28,864 --> 00:39:31,632
One, they don't recognize it.

988
00:39:31,634 --> 00:39:33,400
Which means I don't need
to worry about them.

989
00:39:33,402 --> 00:39:34,902
Two,
they know I did it,

990
00:39:34,904 --> 00:39:36,670
but don't have the balls
to say anything.

991
00:39:36,672 --> 00:39:38,939
Which means I need to worry
about them even less.

992
00:39:39,285 --> 00:39:42,686
Or three, they call me on it.

993
00:39:42,688 --> 00:39:45,322
And believe me,
three is my kind of guy.

994
00:39:46,659 --> 00:39:50,027
Well, in that case,
welcome to the firm.

995
00:39:50,029 --> 00:39:52,029
Glad to be here.

996
00:39:52,031 --> 00:39:55,966
Oh, and by the way,
I would have won.

997
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:11,920
Alex.

998
00:40:11,922 --> 00:40:13,522
It's 10:00 at night;
what are you doing?

999
00:40:13,524 --> 00:40:15,324
I'm going through every one
of Samantha Wheeler's files.

1000
00:40:15,326 --> 00:40:18,160
'Cause a fight's coming,
and I'm gonna be ready.

1001
00:40:18,162 --> 00:40:20,329
Okay, listen to me.

1002
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:24,967
Because, believe me,
I've been where you are before.

1003
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:26,835
Don't start something
that you'll regret later.

1004
00:40:26,837 --> 00:40:27,936
Then what am
I supposed to do?

1005
00:40:27,938 --> 00:40:29,505
How 'bout you make
a friend now

1006
00:40:29,507 --> 00:40:30,939
that you'll be
happy about later.

1007
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:33,141
Are you crazy? She's not
looking to make friends.

1008
00:40:33,143 --> 00:40:34,743
Maybe not, but, Alex,
listen to me.

1009
00:40:34,745 --> 00:40:36,778
In the long run,
this woman is going nowhere.

1010
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,381
Got Harvey and me on your side.
You get the trifecta,

1011
00:40:39,383 --> 00:40:42,050
I don't care what she does.
Never gonna beat you again.

1012
00:40:42,052 --> 00:40:44,453
Are you suggesting I kiss
Robert Zane's ass?

1013
00:40:44,455 --> 00:40:46,421
'Cause I'm not gonna do that.
- No, Alex.

1014
00:40:46,423 --> 00:40:49,175
I'm just saying
get to know the man.

1015
00:40:49,176 --> 00:40:51,209
And how exactly would you
suggest I do that?

1016
00:40:51,211 --> 00:40:53,011
That's up to you.
I happen to know

1017
00:40:53,013 --> 00:40:54,813
the man plays golf.
So do you.

1018
00:40:54,815 --> 00:40:58,550
If it were up to me,
I would start right there.

1019
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,403
Make yourself at home.

1020
00:41:16,405 --> 00:41:18,338
Don't mind if I do.

1021
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:21,942
Well, as long as you're here.

1022
00:41:21,944 --> 00:41:24,311
You came through,
like always.

1023
00:41:24,313 --> 00:41:25,979
Thanks, Samantha.
- Like always.

1024
00:41:25,981 --> 00:41:28,549
What happened to, "You let me
down a time or two"?

1025
00:41:28,551 --> 00:41:30,984
Come on, you know I get like
that sometimes.

1026
00:41:32,054 --> 00:41:33,820
What's going on?
Something on your mind?

1027
00:41:33,822 --> 00:41:36,023
Yeah, there is.
I did what you asked and

1028
00:41:36,025 --> 00:41:38,802
now I have something to ask.
- What's that?

1029
00:41:38,803 --> 00:41:41,004
I don't want to just be
your Michael Clayton.

1030
00:41:41,006 --> 00:41:43,373
I want more.

1031
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:46,177
- I'm married.
- Come on, Robert.

1032
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:48,346
You know what I want,
and it's time.

1033
00:41:48,348 --> 00:41:50,014
Samantha,
we've been over this.

1034
00:41:50,016 --> 00:41:52,950
You get name partner, and
you're not going to be able

1035
00:41:52,952 --> 00:41:54,652
to operate the way
you always have.

1036
00:41:54,654 --> 00:41:56,448
You mean I won't be able
to clean up your messes.

1037
00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:58,883
My messes aren't
the only ones you clean up.

1038
00:41:58,885 --> 00:42:00,685
I believe you spend half
the time cleaning up your own.

1039
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:02,987
Oh, is that what I spent
the last few days doing?

1040
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:04,956
- Samantha?
- Robert, I want name partner.

1041
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:06,924
And I want it before
the year is out.

1042
00:42:06,926 --> 00:42:08,793
Or what?

1043
00:42:08,795 --> 00:42:10,895
Before the year is out,
Robert.
