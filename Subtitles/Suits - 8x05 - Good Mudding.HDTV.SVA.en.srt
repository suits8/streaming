1
00:00:00,038 --> 00:00:01,354
<i>Previously, on "Suits..."</i>

2
00:00:01,355 --> 00:00:03,690
There's a whole life
going on here

3
00:00:03,725 --> 00:00:05,525
that you're not even a part of.

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,226
You think I don't know
what I've missed?

5
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:09,395
I'm not just talking about
birthdays, Harvey.

6
00:00:09,431 --> 00:00:10,363
I got sick again.
- What?

7
00:00:10,398 --> 00:00:11,831
Why didn't you tell me?

8
00:00:11,866 --> 00:00:13,299
- Did you know?
- Know what?

9
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:14,300
That Gavin Andrews
was gonna ask me

10
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,668
to launder money
for him?

11
00:00:15,704 --> 00:00:16,869
Help me get out of this.

12
00:00:16,905 --> 00:00:18,271
Please, Samantha.

13
00:00:18,306 --> 00:00:20,406
I should have listened to you,
but I have a family.

14
00:00:20,442 --> 00:00:22,742
I want to make a perfect baby
with you.

15
00:00:22,777 --> 00:00:24,611
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

16
00:00:24,646 --> 00:00:26,579
And I don't want to just be
pulling the goalie.

17
00:00:26,615 --> 00:00:29,382
I want to start trying, and I
want to start trying right now.

18
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:31,684
I know you think we're in
competition for the same thing,

19
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,819
but we're not.

20
00:00:32,854 --> 00:00:35,221
Robert Zane made me a promise:

21
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:36,834
the next name that goes up on
the wall is mine.

22
00:00:36,858 --> 00:00:38,424
Why are you telling me this?

23
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,604
Because we're never gonna
trust each other

24
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:40,638
if you think I'm trying to get
ahead of you.

25
00:00:40,662 --> 00:00:43,084
I'm not, because I already am.

26
00:00:47,268 --> 00:00:48,201
Sheila.

27
00:00:48,236 --> 00:00:49,936
It's after 9:00.
You're gonna be late.

28
00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:51,415
Then I'll be late,
because there's something

29
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,673
I need to ask you.
- Yeah, of course.

30
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,119
- You can ask me anything.
- Louis, have you ever gotten

31
00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:57,143
a woman pregnant before?

32
00:00:57,178 --> 00:00:59,278
Okay, uh...
[laughs]

33
00:00:59,314 --> 00:01:01,347
Where is this going?

34
00:01:01,383 --> 00:01:04,751
I'm asking because
you haven't gotten this woman

35
00:01:04,786 --> 00:01:06,419
pregnant yet either.

36
00:01:06,454 --> 00:01:08,187
Sheila,
we just started trying,

37
00:01:08,223 --> 00:01:09,433
and I think
what I've been doing

38
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:10,701
is more than meeting
the standards.

39
00:01:10,725 --> 00:01:12,859
Louis, you are
an A/A-plus lover.

40
00:01:12,894 --> 00:01:14,494
Everyone knows that.
- There's a slash?

41
00:01:14,529 --> 00:01:16,129
That's not the point.
The point is,

42
00:01:16,164 --> 00:01:17,930
have you ever considered
the possibility

43
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:20,466
that you're shooting blanks?
- No more than I would consider

44
00:01:20,502 --> 00:01:21,812
the possibility
that I don't have a face.

45
00:01:21,836 --> 00:01:24,537
I get that, Louis,
and you probably have the sperm

46
00:01:24,572 --> 00:01:27,273
of a thoroughbred,
but I'd like you

47
00:01:27,308 --> 00:01:29,409
to get yourself checked.
- Sheila, if you're asking

48
00:01:29,444 --> 00:01:31,222
what I think you are,
I don't want to go to a place

49
00:01:31,246 --> 00:01:33,312
where people do...

50
00:01:33,348 --> 00:01:34,881
that...

51
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:36,315
unless it's
absolutely necessary.

52
00:01:36,351 --> 00:01:38,651
I get that, too,
but the fact is,

53
00:01:38,687 --> 00:01:40,564
I'm not getting any younger
and we don't have time

54
00:01:40,588 --> 00:01:43,256
to waste, so I'm getting
myself checked,

55
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,725
and I'm asking you
to do the same.

56
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,428
So here's the address.

57
00:01:48,463 --> 00:01:51,030
You have an appointment today.

58
00:01:53,535 --> 00:01:55,768
Okay, Sheila,
I'll get it done.

59
00:01:55,804 --> 00:01:57,737
Thank you.

60
00:01:57,772 --> 00:01:59,772
Harvey, do you have a second?

61
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,641
- Sure, Louis, what is it?
- Did you ever have

62
00:02:01,676 --> 00:02:03,409
to test your sperm?

63
00:02:03,445 --> 00:02:05,011
- What?
- Sheila wants me to,

64
00:02:05,046 --> 00:02:06,657
but I don't think I can do it
in one of those places.

65
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:08,426
Louis, I don't want
to have this conversation.

66
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,860
It's bad enough
that we share the same dentist.

67
00:02:09,884 --> 00:02:11,584
Harvey, come on.

68
00:02:11,619 --> 00:02:14,353
We're trying to have a baby,
and I don't have anyone else

69
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:16,622
to talk to about this.

70
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:18,591
Okay, what--
what's your problem?

71
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:22,361
Problem is, I've never had
to do it under duress before.

72
00:02:22,397 --> 00:02:24,530
I don't know how.
- Well, why don't you do it

73
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:25,932
like everyone else does?

74
00:02:25,967 --> 00:02:27,600
Use pictures.
- I don't use pictures.

75
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:28,501
I only think of Sheila,
and I can't do that

76
00:02:28,536 --> 00:02:30,002
with a bunch
of strangers there.

77
00:02:30,038 --> 00:02:31,382
Well, what did you do
before Sheila?

78
00:02:31,406 --> 00:02:33,439
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Well, I don't want

79
00:02:33,475 --> 00:02:34,518
to talk about any of this.
- Harvey, come on.

80
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:36,776
[sighs]
All right, look...

81
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:38,644
you can't use pictures;
you don't want

82
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,012
to think about Sheila.

83
00:02:40,048 --> 00:02:41,492
Well, then, you'll have
to think of something

84
00:02:41,516 --> 00:02:42,593
that turns you on
that isn't Sheila.

85
00:02:42,617 --> 00:02:46,319
You mean think about
an inanimate object.

86
00:02:46,354 --> 00:02:48,354
Yes, Louis,
that's what I mean.

87
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:49,967
- Have you done that before?
- Of course I have.

88
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:51,469
- What do you use?
- No, I'm not telling you that.

89
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:53,726
Harvey, please.

90
00:02:53,762 --> 00:02:57,563
All right.
You want the truth?

91
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,665
Sometimes...

92
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:01,567
I think about...

93
00:03:01,603 --> 00:03:03,369
tomatoes.

94
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:06,305
- Really?
- Well, if you think about it,

95
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:08,474
they're the most sensual fruit.
- I thought they were

96
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,076
a vegetable?
- I am opening my soul

97
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:11,644
to you here;
don't criticize me.

98
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:13,045
I'm sorry, you're right.

99
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:16,015
Thank you, Harvey.

100
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,818
Good luck in there, buddy.

101
00:03:18,853 --> 00:03:20,987
Yeah.
Tomatoes, holy shit.

102
00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:23,022
Never thought of that.

103
00:03:26,961 --> 00:03:28,995
You wanna tell me
what that was all about?

104
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,997
No, because I'm guessing
you listened

105
00:03:31,032 --> 00:03:33,833
to the entire conversation,
which means you know

106
00:03:33,868 --> 00:03:35,768
what it's about.
- In that case,

107
00:03:35,804 --> 00:03:37,948
what I really want to know is:
is it true about the tomatoes?

108
00:03:37,972 --> 00:03:39,939
I think we both know
it's not.

109
00:03:39,974 --> 00:03:42,542
Just like we both know
it's really strawberries

110
00:03:42,577 --> 00:03:44,977
and whipped cream.

111
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:47,413
What, too soon?
- No.

112
00:03:47,448 --> 00:03:49,382
But this is an office,
and someone could overhear

113
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:51,751
and misunderstand that
that was 13 years ago.

114
00:03:51,786 --> 00:03:53,019
Really?
'Cause it feels like

115
00:03:53,054 --> 00:03:54,554
12 and 1/2 to me.

116
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:57,056
- You're an idiot.
- No, Louis is an idiot.

117
00:03:57,091 --> 00:04:00,860
because he believed
I think about tomatoes.

118
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:03,029
And if Sheila wants him
to get his swimmers checked,

119
00:04:03,064 --> 00:04:05,364
we shouldn't mock
that he has to do that...

120
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,033
in a cup...

121
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:09,602
thinking about tomatoes.
- You're absolutely right.

122
00:04:09,637 --> 00:04:11,137
We should take it
very seriously.

123
00:04:11,172 --> 00:04:13,639
Tomatoes.
- Okay, you know what?

124
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:15,875
As much as I would love
to do this all day,

125
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,579
I came in here to tell you
you need to call Marcus.

126
00:04:19,614 --> 00:04:20,913
Marcus?
About what?

127
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:22,882
I don't know,
but he left me a message

128
00:04:22,917 --> 00:04:24,662
that he wants you to call him.
- Well, if he wants me to call,

129
00:04:24,686 --> 00:04:26,619
why would he be leaving
a message for you?

130
00:04:26,654 --> 00:04:29,555
Because when Marcus
really needs you, he calls me.

131
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:31,490
He's only ever done that twice,

132
00:04:31,526 --> 00:04:34,727
which means whatever it is
he needs, it's important.

133
00:04:36,497 --> 00:04:39,031
All right, Donna,
I'll call him.

134
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:41,467
Today, Harvey.

135
00:04:41,502 --> 00:04:42,802
Today.

136
00:04:50,945 --> 00:04:52,178
Hey, Harvey.

137
00:04:52,213 --> 00:04:53,946
I'm glad you called.

138
00:04:53,982 --> 00:04:55,092
I take it Donna
gave you my message?

139
00:04:55,116 --> 00:04:57,516
She did.
What's going on?

140
00:04:57,552 --> 00:04:59,685
<i>- I'm getting a divorce.</i>
- What?

141
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:00,887
<i>I know.</i>

142
00:05:00,922 --> 00:05:03,522
And I know it is a big ask,

143
00:05:03,558 --> 00:05:05,625
but I was hoping
that you could represent me.

144
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,760
Marcus, hold on.
When did this happen?

145
00:05:07,795 --> 00:05:09,540
The last time I was up there
everything seemed fine.

146
00:05:09,564 --> 00:05:11,797
Yeah, well, it's not fine,
and as much as I hate it,

147
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,966
this is what she wants.
- If you want me to help you,

148
00:05:14,002 --> 00:05:15,768
I'm gonna need
to know more than that.

149
00:05:15,803 --> 00:05:16,535
<i>What do you want me</i>
<i>to tell you, Harvey?</i>

150
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:18,504
<i>That we grew apart?</i>

151
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:19,783
Well, we did.
<i>- Bullshit, I know you.</i>

152
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:22,775
It's not the full story.
<i>- You're right, it's not,</i>

153
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,655
and I will tell you everything
when you get up here.

154
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:26,112
<i>I didn't say</i>
<i>I was coming up there,</i>

155
00:05:26,147 --> 00:05:27,625
and I'm not going to
unless you tell me

156
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:28,915
what's going on, right now.

157
00:05:33,021 --> 00:05:35,121
I slept with someone,
all right?

158
00:05:35,156 --> 00:05:37,156
- You did what?
<i>- I was stupid,</i>

159
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:39,125
and I had an affair,
and I know you want

160
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,661
to rip my head off right now--
<i>- You're damn right, I do!</i>

161
00:05:41,696 --> 00:05:43,696
'Cause you know better
than anyone

162
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:46,232
what that does to a family.
- Right now, I don't care.

163
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:47,578
What the hell
did you just say to me?

164
00:05:47,602 --> 00:05:49,635
<i>Harvey, you're always</i>
<i>telling your clients</i>

165
00:05:49,671 --> 00:05:51,637
that your issues
are your issues

166
00:05:51,673 --> 00:05:53,550
and that you don't judge people
for what they do.

167
00:05:53,574 --> 00:05:55,975
<i>So right now I don't need</i>
<i>to hear how I screwed up.</i>

168
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,988
What I need to hear is that
you're on your way up here

169
00:05:58,012 --> 00:06:00,146
to help make sure
that I don't lose my kids.

170
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:01,714
What are you talking about?

171
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:03,816
I'm talking about custody,
Harvey,

00:06:03,851 --> 00:06:06,085
<i>because Katie hired a shark</i>
<i>to represent her.</i>

173
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,887

you didn't want this

174

<i>- I can't risk</i>

175

and the best way I know

176
00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:13,537
to avoid a fight is to show up

Now let's get you set up

00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:00,307

- You mean the room

193
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:02,074

I can literally see from here?

194
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,120
Joy, I don't need
to have any attitude.

00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:08,214
I can set myself up, Dad,
thanks.

- [sighs]
- These associates get younger

197
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:13,451

- That's not an associate;

198

that's my daughter.
- And you think

I didn't know that?

200
00:07:16,256 --> 00:07:18,123
I can spot
a ninth-grade pushback

00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:24,529

- I mean, Joy got in trouble

204
00:07:24,564 --> 00:07:26,097
at school,
that's why she's here.

205
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:27,665

Your daughter won't listen
and you don't want

- No, I just don't know

211
00:07:36,176 --> 00:07:37,453
what to say to her
to get her to hear me.

212
00:07:37,477 --> 00:07:39,310
That's because sometimes
there is no way

214
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:42,080
But they might
hear someone else.

215
00:07:42,115 --> 00:07:44,516
Someone--someone cool.

216
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:46,418
- Someone like you?
- No, no, no.

217
00:07:46,453 --> 00:07:48,319
Not me.
- Come on, Gretchen,

218
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:50,266
what's it gonna take?
- I'm not saying I won't do it.

219
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,723
I'm saying it won't work.
- Why not?

220
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:55,493
Because it can't be someone
you think is cool...

221
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:57,195
It has to be someone
she thinks is cool.

222
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,930
Well, look at that.

223
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:00,532

and represent him.
- So what are you gonna do?

339
00:12:05,478 --> 00:12:07,211
What do you think
I'm gonna do?

340
00:12:07,247 --> 00:12:08,391
I'm gonna help him.
- Okay, look, I have to ask--

341
00:12:08,415 --> 00:12:09,759
are you sure
that you want to do this?

342
00:12:09,783 --> 00:12:13,184
I appreciate your concern,
Donna, but it's my brother.

343
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:14,859
What am I supposed to do?
- All I'm saying

344
00:12:14,888 --> 00:12:16,532
is that this could bring up
a lot of shit for you.

345
00:12:16,556 --> 00:12:18,856
And I don't disagree,
but like I said,

346
00:12:18,892 --> 00:12:21,225
it's my brother.

347
00:12:21,261 --> 00:12:24,228
What am I supposed to do?
- Okay.

348
00:12:24,264 --> 00:12:26,531
But before you go,
after what just happened

349
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:28,866
I think you should tell Robert.
- I already did.

350
00:12:28,902 --> 00:12:30,535
How did he take it?

351
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,537
I have to give him credit,
he--

352
00:12:32,572 --> 00:12:33,871
he didn't hesitate
for a second.

353
00:12:33,907 --> 00:12:35,807
He said,
"Family comes first.

354
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:38,343
Always does, always will."

355
00:12:45,914 --> 00:12:47,415
You must be Joy.

356
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,417
That's the name they gave me.

357
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:51,264
I'm Samantha.

358
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:52,265
Your dad's gonna be stuck
in meetings all day,

359
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,002
so he asked me
to check in on you.

360
00:12:56,037 --> 00:12:57,603
Samantha, is it?

361
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,572
He didn't ask you
to check in on me.

362
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:01,507
He asked you
to keep an eye on me

363
00:13:01,543 --> 00:13:02,942
because you're the cool one.

364
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:04,644
Well, you might be cool to him,

365
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,813
but you're not cool to me.

366
00:13:07,749 --> 00:13:09,782
Okay.

367
00:13:09,818 --> 00:13:13,052
I see what this is.

368
00:13:13,088 --> 00:13:15,621
I'll tell you mine
if you tell me yours.

369
00:13:15,657 --> 00:13:18,024
- Your what?
- My "why I got suspended."

370
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:20,960
- You got suspended?
- Just once.

371
00:13:20,995 --> 00:13:23,996
But from three
different schools.

372
00:13:27,335 --> 00:13:28,868
That's the football field.

373
00:13:28,903 --> 00:13:30,737
I used industrial bleach.

374
00:13:30,772 --> 00:13:32,605
That shit's not coming out
for months.

375
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,943
Wow, that is
some colorful language.

376
00:13:36,978 --> 00:13:38,811
So what'd you do?

377
00:13:38,847 --> 00:13:40,613
The worst one?

378
00:13:40,648 --> 00:13:42,448
I boosted a car
from the school parking lot.

379
00:13:42,484 --> 00:13:44,517
- You stole somebody's car.
- Not somebody's,

380
00:13:44,552 --> 00:13:45,785
the principal's.

381
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,954
Turns out that is not
a good idea.

382
00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:49,055
Got it.

383
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,324
Don't steal
the principal's car.

384
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:53,426
I'm not saying
breaking the rules

385
00:13:53,461 --> 00:13:54,560
is a bad thing.

386
00:13:54,596 --> 00:13:57,797
I'm saying you just need
to know which ones to break.

387
00:13:58,967 --> 00:14:01,401
I don't think you're supposed
to tell me that.

388
00:14:01,436 --> 00:14:03,336
Maybe not,
but if you're gonna help me

389
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:05,905
the next couple of days,
you should know how I work.

390
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,473
- Help you?
- Yeah.

391
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:08,586
I've got a deposition
this afternoon

392
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,810
and nothing to force
the other guy's hand.

393
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:11,978
You in?

394
00:14:12,013 --> 00:14:13,646
- I'm in.
- Well, then, Joy,

395
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:16,048
you and I
are gonna need some coffee.

396
00:14:18,787 --> 00:14:21,421
[door bell chiming]

397
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:27,427
Harvey,
what are you doing here?

398
00:14:27,462 --> 00:14:30,997
I'm here because Marcus
asked me to represent him.

399
00:14:31,032 --> 00:14:32,832
Then you shouldn't
be contacting me

400
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:35,034
without my lawyer.
- No, I shouldn't.

401
00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:36,969
But I'm not here as a lawyer.

402
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:38,671
I'm here
as your brother-in-law.

403
00:14:38,706 --> 00:14:40,518
- What does that mean?
- It means I know Marcus

404
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:43,376
still loves you, and...

405
00:14:43,411 --> 00:14:45,144
I need to know
if there isn't still a way

406
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,779
that you guys
can work this out.

407
00:14:46,815 --> 00:14:48,359
And as much as I wish
that could happen,

408
00:14:48,383 --> 00:14:49,682
it's too late for that.

409
00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:51,617
Look, Marcus told me
what happened...

410
00:14:51,653 --> 00:14:52,618
And you're still
standing here

411
00:14:52,654 --> 00:14:54,987
trying to defend him.
- No, I'm not.

412
00:14:55,023 --> 00:14:58,624
When he told me, believe me,
I wanted to lay him out myself,

413
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,960
but I also know
what it feels like

414
00:15:00,995 --> 00:15:02,740
to have your family
ripped apart, and I don't want

415
00:15:02,764 --> 00:15:04,697
to see that happen.
- You think I do?

416
00:15:04,732 --> 00:15:06,966
No, I don't,
but I'm telling you,

417
00:15:07,001 --> 00:15:09,869
the second
lawyers get involved...

418
00:15:09,904 --> 00:15:11,070
it's gonna get messy.

419
00:15:11,105 --> 00:15:12,905
It's already messy, Harvey.

420
00:15:12,941 --> 00:15:14,674
And my lawyer's
already involved,

421
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:17,543
so be Marcus' lawyer or don't,

422
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:20,613
but either way
I can't talk to you anymore.

423
00:15:27,922 --> 00:15:29,989
No, no, you sit here.

424
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:32,525
- Why?
- Those two over there

425
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,393
are opposing council
and his client.

426
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:35,394
What does that have to do
with where I sit?

427
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,497
It has to do
with where I sit.

428
00:15:37,532 --> 00:15:40,066
- I don't understand.
- Let me explain.

429
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:43,202
I have nothing on this asshole,
but I know he's lying.

430
00:15:43,238 --> 00:15:45,605
So I'm going to bluff him
in an hour,

431
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,073
and this is where
that bluff starts.

432
00:15:47,108 --> 00:15:48,574
So you're just gonna
stare at him?

433
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,010
No, I'm also going to laugh

434
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:52,778
and drink my coffee
and show him

435
00:15:52,814 --> 00:15:54,847
how incredibly confident I am.

436
00:15:54,883 --> 00:15:55,915
I get it.

437
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,783
You're trying
to get in their heads.

438
00:15:57,819 --> 00:16:00,720
- Not trying, doing.
- Awesome.

439
00:16:00,755 --> 00:16:02,622
I'll get us some drinks.
- You're buying?

440
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:04,590
- My dad's buying.
- In that case,

441
00:16:04,626 --> 00:16:07,793
I will take a dozen bagels,
seven donuts, and...

442
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:10,730
one of those fancy
espresso machines over there.

443
00:16:16,771 --> 00:16:18,204
Don't tell me--
the results are in.

444
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:19,939
- They are.
- And?

445
00:16:19,974 --> 00:16:21,485
They want me to meet
with the doctor in person.

446
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:22,942
- And?
- And I want you

447
00:16:22,977 --> 00:16:25,545
to come with me.
- Louis, I--

448
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,246
I don't mean
to sound insensitive,

449
00:16:27,282 --> 00:16:29,615
but I really think
that you should do this

450
00:16:29,651 --> 00:16:31,484
on your own.
- Donna...

451
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,618
they said "in person."

452
00:16:32,654 --> 00:16:34,265
That can't be good.
- But don't they do that

453
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:35,821
for everyone?
- Maybe they do,

454
00:16:35,857 --> 00:16:37,223
but I just don't want
to be alone.

455
00:16:37,258 --> 00:16:39,125
And I understand that,
but I'm not the woman

456
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,960
you should be asking.

457
00:16:40,995 --> 00:16:43,496
- Sheila.
- She's your partner in this.

458
00:16:43,531 --> 00:16:45,598
I know that, but what if...

459
00:16:45,633 --> 00:16:47,767
- What if what?
- Donna, if I'm the reason

460
00:16:47,802 --> 00:16:50,102
we can't have kids,
I wanna be the one to tell her.

461
00:16:50,138 --> 00:16:52,004
Not some guy in a lab coat.

462
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,741
And if you really want me
to go with you, I will, but...

463
00:16:55,777 --> 00:16:56,887
if I were Sheila,
I wouldn't want

464
00:16:56,911 --> 00:17:00,646
to be the second woman
in your life to find that out.

465
00:17:00,682 --> 00:17:02,815
You're right, Donna.

466
00:17:08,156 --> 00:17:09,922
Don't tell me
they ran out of coffee.

467
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,792
No, I got something better
than coffee.

468
00:17:17,198 --> 00:17:19,498
I didn't know what to do,
so I just hit "record."

469
00:17:19,534 --> 00:17:22,602
Does it help?
- It sure as shit doesn't hurt.

470
00:17:22,637 --> 00:17:23,714
Huh.
- Does that mean you don't have

471
00:17:23,738 --> 00:17:25,605
to sit here and smile at them?

472
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,540
No, it just means
it's gonna be

473
00:17:27,575 --> 00:17:29,775
a hell of a lot more fun.

474
00:17:30,812 --> 00:17:33,279
[laughs]

475
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,783
Harvey.

476
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:39,552
You were supposed to be here
an hour ago.

477
00:17:39,587 --> 00:17:40,864
There was something
I had to do first.

478
00:17:40,888 --> 00:17:42,521
Yeah, I know
what you had to do,

479
00:17:42,557 --> 00:17:44,034
and I wish you hadn't done it.
- Listen to me...

480
00:17:44,058 --> 00:17:45,703
Harvey, you said
you were gonna come up here

481
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,137
and help me, not stir things up
with Katie.

482
00:17:47,161 --> 00:17:48,995
Marcus, you said
you wanted peace, so I tried

483
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,263
to make peace.
- Yeah, well, what you did

484
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:53,966
was make it worse.

485
00:17:56,237 --> 00:17:57,837
- Shit.
- What does that mean,

486
00:17:57,872 --> 00:18:00,072
"You've been sanctioned"?

487
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:02,041
Look, it's a fine

488
00:18:02,076 --> 00:18:04,043
for contacting her
without her lawyer.

489
00:18:04,078 --> 00:18:05,878
It's nothing.
- No, I know you,

490
00:18:05,913 --> 00:18:07,546
and there's something else.

491
00:18:07,582 --> 00:18:09,849
[sighs]

492
00:18:09,884 --> 00:18:13,085
If I file some kind of motion
and it's a coin toss,

493
00:18:13,121 --> 00:18:15,855
the judge probably rules
in their favor.

494
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,025
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Marcus, I am sorry.

495
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,526
You asked me to come up here,

496
00:18:20,561 --> 00:18:23,362
and like it or not...

497
00:18:24,532 --> 00:18:27,900
This is tough for me too,
so I tried with Katie.

498
00:18:27,935 --> 00:18:29,602
Okay, Harvey, I get it.

499
00:18:29,637 --> 00:18:30,914
I just wish
there was a chance in hell

500
00:18:30,938 --> 00:18:32,938
that it would've worked.

501
00:18:32,974 --> 00:18:34,607
So what are we gonna do now?

502
00:18:34,642 --> 00:18:35,886
I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

503
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,777
You want a peaceful settlement,

504
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:39,845
we're gonna get you
a peaceful settlement.

505
00:18:43,554 --> 00:18:45,133
- Mr. Litt.
- Yes.

506
00:18:45,134 --> 00:18:46,867
- Please, have a seat.
- Oh, my God,

507
00:18:46,903 --> 00:18:48,550
it's worse than I thought.
I have no sperm at all.

508
00:18:48,551 --> 00:18:50,017
[laughs]
Of course not.

509
00:18:50,053 --> 00:18:52,386
In fact, I'm happy
to inform you

510
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,456
that your sperm count
is perfectly fine.

511
00:18:55,491 --> 00:18:57,124
I see no reason
why you can't make

512
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,727
any healthy woman pregnant.
- Great, fantastic.

513
00:18:59,762 --> 00:19:00,839
There is one thing, however.

514
00:19:00,863 --> 00:19:02,063
- One thing.
- I noticed

515
00:19:02,098 --> 00:19:03,208
on the lifestyle section
of our form,

516
00:19:03,232 --> 00:19:05,733
you put down "mudding."
- Yeah.

517
00:19:05,768 --> 00:19:08,469
[laughs]
Yes, it relaxes and soothes me.

518
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:09,948
Come to think of it, doc,
I think that's the reason

519
00:19:09,972 --> 00:19:12,940
why my count is so robust.
- You'll have to give it up.

520
00:19:12,975 --> 00:19:14,675
- What now?
- Well, your count is fine,

521
00:19:14,711 --> 00:19:16,622
but due to your partner's age--
if you give up mudding,

522
00:19:16,646 --> 00:19:19,480
your chances of conceiving
go up significantly.

523
00:19:19,515 --> 00:19:21,749
- Define significantly.
- 80%.

524
00:19:21,784 --> 00:19:23,918
Holy shit, 80%?

525
00:19:23,953 --> 00:19:25,920
There's gotta be another way!
- There isn't.

526
00:19:25,955 --> 00:19:27,099
What if I put everything in
but my balls?

527
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:28,756
- I don't...
- Scratch that,

528
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:29,757
defeats the purpose.
- Mr. Litt...

529
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:31,792
What if I cut down
on my sessions?

530
00:19:31,828 --> 00:19:32,793
I cut it down in half,
it improves our chances 40%.

531
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:35,162
I'm afraid
it doesn't work that way.

532
00:19:35,198 --> 00:19:36,341
Well, then what are you
telling me?

533
00:19:36,365 --> 00:19:37,409
I'm telling you
that if you want to have

534
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:39,767
the best chance
at having a child,

535
00:19:39,802 --> 00:19:41,969
you'll give up mudding
for the foreseeable future.

536
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:45,973
Excuse me.

537
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:47,286
Who is she,
and what's she doing here?

538
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,587
It's "go to work
with your parent" day.

539
00:19:48,611 --> 00:19:49,376
She's your daughter?

540
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:51,045
Something like that.

541
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,858
But of course, if you're too
afraid to have her here,

542
00:19:52,882 --> 00:19:54,526
she doesn't have to be here.
- Fine with me if she stays,

543
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,950
since this is gonna be

544
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:57,129
the world's
shortest deposition

545
00:19:57,153 --> 00:19:58,430
Because you're ready
to admit you infringed

546
00:19:58,454 --> 00:20:01,622
on my client's patent to create
your generic knock-off?

547
00:20:01,657 --> 00:20:03,924
Because, my company
developed that drug

548
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,360
from scratch, and your client
has no proof we didn't.

549
00:20:06,395 --> 00:20:08,140
Actually, we do have proof,
we're just not gonna use it.

550
00:20:08,164 --> 00:20:09,830
[laughs]
You're not gonna use it

551
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:11,866
because it doesn't exist.
- I'm not gonna use it

552
00:20:11,901 --> 00:20:13,501
because I'd like you
to lie to my face

553
00:20:13,536 --> 00:20:14,969
in this deposition.

554
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:17,638
And why is that?
- So when I reveal what we know

555
00:20:17,673 --> 00:20:19,807
in open court,
you not only lose this case,

556
00:20:19,842 --> 00:20:21,742
you get charged with perjury.

557
00:20:21,778 --> 00:20:23,178
Can't you get sent
to jail for that?

558
00:20:23,212 --> 00:20:25,079
Why, yes, Joy, you can.

559
00:20:25,114 --> 00:20:26,647
But you'd probably
go bankrupt, first,

560
00:20:26,682 --> 00:20:29,650
trying to fight it.
both: Hmm.

561
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:31,218
You're bluffing.

562
00:20:31,254 --> 00:20:32,486
You don't have shit on him.

563
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,755
I guess there's only one way
to find out.

564
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,891
So, Mr. Coleman, did you
or did you not

565
00:20:36,926 --> 00:20:39,727
rip off our patent to create
your bullshit new drug?

566
00:20:39,762 --> 00:20:41,662
And before you answer,

567
00:20:41,697 --> 00:20:44,732
I'd like you to think back
to that decaf latte

568
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:46,767
you were drinking
before coming up here.

569
00:20:46,803 --> 00:20:49,770
And, more specifically,
to the person waiting in line

570
00:20:49,806 --> 00:20:51,572
by your table...

571
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:55,209
while you were trying so hard
not to look at me.

572
00:20:55,244 --> 00:20:57,111
That's what she's doing here.

573
00:20:57,146 --> 00:20:59,280
You set us up.
- You set yourself up

574
00:20:59,315 --> 00:21:00,848
because you went
to a public place

575
00:21:00,883 --> 00:21:02,516
and discussed a case
loud enough

576
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,218
for a 15-year-old girl
who just happened

577
00:21:04,253 --> 00:21:07,621
to be recording the coffee shop
to pick you up on tape.

578
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:10,257
Now, for the last time...

579
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,227
Where'd your new drug
come from?

580
00:21:19,305 --> 00:21:22,006
All right.

581
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:23,541
How much do you want?

582
00:21:27,714 --> 00:21:30,048
Gentlemen,
sorry to keep you waiting.

583
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,749
My client and I
were just discussing

584
00:21:31,785 --> 00:21:34,218
a few last matters.
- Not a problem.

585
00:21:34,254 --> 00:21:36,220
Now that you're ready,
I suggest we start

586
00:21:36,256 --> 00:21:38,234
with division of property.
- Actually, we'd like to start

587
00:21:38,258 --> 00:21:40,058
with the most
important issue...

588
00:21:40,093 --> 00:21:41,459
- Our kids.
- Exactly.

589
00:21:41,494 --> 00:21:43,127
Because we're seeking
sole custody.

590
00:21:43,163 --> 00:21:45,329
What?
We--we didn't talk about that.

591
00:21:45,365 --> 00:21:47,231
And what was
or wasn't previously discussed

592
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:48,482
is irrelevant.
- That's bull--

593
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:49,883
Marcus, let me handle this.

594
00:21:49,918 --> 00:21:52,915
Because they don't really want
sole custody, they just want

595
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,914
to start on one end
because they're expecting us

596
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:55,951
to start on the other.

597
00:21:55,952 --> 00:21:58,533
But we don't want a fight,
so why don't we just all start

598
00:21:58,534 --> 00:22:00,051
in the middle?
- I'll tell you why--

599
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,193
because we're not moving
on this at all.

600
00:22:02,313 --> 00:22:04,799
- Excuse me?
- Katie, don't do this.

601
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,500
You did this
to yourself, Marcus.

602
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:08,068
No, he didn't.
He may have screwed up,

603
00:22:08,103 --> 00:22:11,171
but you don't have the grounds
to take the kids.

604
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:13,273
- Actually, we do.
- Bullshit.

605
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:14,553
And I'm not gonna let you
play games like you did

606
00:22:14,577 --> 00:22:16,877
with those sanctions.
- What sanctions?

607
00:22:16,912 --> 00:22:18,278
You know what sanctions.

608
00:22:18,314 --> 00:22:19,691
The ones you had your lawyer
slap me with

609
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:22,382
for coming to talk to you.
- I didn't authorize

610
00:22:22,418 --> 00:22:23,962
anything like that.
- You didn't need to.

611
00:22:23,986 --> 00:22:26,386
After you told me
he approached you improperly...

612
00:22:26,422 --> 00:22:27,899
You thought it was
a good idea to use that

613
00:22:27,923 --> 00:22:29,690
to bias the judge.
- I thought it would be

614
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:31,692
a good idea to protect
my client's interests.

615
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:34,528
Well, those kids aren't just
your client's interests.

616
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:36,497
They're my brother's children--

617
00:22:36,532 --> 00:22:38,143
Well, then maybe
he should have cared enough

618
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:39,800
to put their needs
ahead of his own.

619
00:22:39,835 --> 00:22:41,635
Katie, he may not have been
a perfect husband,

620
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:44,404
but I am not gonna let you say
he's not a good father.

621
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,306
How would you know
what kind of a father he is?

622
00:22:46,342 --> 00:22:48,475
I'll tell you how.
Every time I have seen them

623
00:22:48,511 --> 00:22:51,378
with him, every time
he has told me about them...

624
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,213
And what about
what he told you

625
00:22:53,249 --> 00:22:54,860
about why we're splitting up?
- Just because he slept

626
00:22:54,884 --> 00:22:55,927
with someone else doesn't mean
he's not a good father.

627
00:22:55,951 --> 00:22:58,585
Slept with someone else?

628
00:22:58,621 --> 00:22:59,653
Oh, my God.

629
00:22:59,688 --> 00:23:01,889
He didn't tell you
what happened, did he?

630
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:03,557
Katie...

631
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:04,636
Marcus,
what's she talking about?

632
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,727
You know what?
You can have that conversation

633
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:08,629
on your own time,
'cause I'm not gonna

634
00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:10,397
let you tell me
this is all my fault

635
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:12,299
when you don't even know
the whole story.

636
00:23:12,334 --> 00:23:14,668
Let me be clear:
I'm taking the kids

637
00:23:14,703 --> 00:23:16,737
because that is what is best
for them.

638
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:18,572
And if you have a problem
with that, Harvey,

639
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,741
you can take it up with
the man sitting next to you,

640
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:22,976
'cause I'm done
defending myself.

641
00:23:25,047 --> 00:23:27,614
Katie!

642
00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:32,452
Okay, you tell me
and you tell me now.

643
00:23:32,488 --> 00:23:34,788
What was that all about?

644
00:23:34,823 --> 00:23:36,924
- I was gambling again.
- I don't believe this...

645
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:38,759
It was just for a few weeks.

646
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:40,305
It was almost a year ago,
and I've been in a program

647
00:23:40,329 --> 00:23:41,428
ever since.
- Let me guess:

648
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,864
you didn't tell Katie,
just like you didn't tell me.

649
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:44,665
- I was going to tell you.
- When?

650
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,033
After the judge took your kids?

651
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:47,834
Because they're right, Marcus.

652
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,503
They do have the grounds
to do that,

653
00:23:49,538 --> 00:23:50,971
and you gave it to them.
- Harvey,

654
00:23:51,006 --> 00:23:52,450
there's gotta be something
you can do here.

655
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:53,618
Not when I don't have
all the facts!

656
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:56,443
I point-blank asked you
what happened, and you said

657
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:57,444
it was because of an affair.

658
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:58,779
Look, I know

659
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:00,747
I should have told you,
but I'm telling you now.

660
00:24:00,783 --> 00:24:02,950
Well, then you tell me,
right now, anything else

661
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:05,852
I should know,
and I mean anything.

662
00:24:07,022 --> 00:24:09,389
Haley caught me
making a bet.

663
00:24:09,425 --> 00:24:11,558
and I told her that I was just
playing a game,

664
00:24:11,594 --> 00:24:13,327
and that it could be
our little secret.

665
00:24:13,362 --> 00:24:14,573
- Are you kidding me?
- Hey, hey--where you going?

666
00:24:14,597 --> 00:24:17,331
- Back to New York.
- No, please, you can't--

667
00:24:17,366 --> 00:24:18,498
These are my kids!

668
00:24:18,534 --> 00:24:21,602
Your kids that you asked
to lie for you.

669
00:24:21,637 --> 00:24:22,681
which makes you no different
than Mom was.

670
00:24:22,705 --> 00:24:23,937
No, that is not fair.

671
00:24:23,973 --> 00:24:26,006
What Mom did
is nothing like this.

672
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:28,775
You asked your kids
to keep your secrets.

673
00:24:28,811 --> 00:24:31,345
How is that different?
- Because it was one time

674
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,991
and Haley had no idea
what I was doing was wrong.

675
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:34,748
You know what?
Tell yourself

676
00:24:34,783 --> 00:24:36,528
whatever you want
about what kind of man you are.

677
00:24:36,552 --> 00:24:37,662
You're not just
a shitty husband;

678
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:40,020
you're a shitty brother,
and I'm done here.

679
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:48,086
[laughs]
What's this for?

680
00:24:48,121 --> 00:24:49,254
[laughs]
Well, I know it was

681
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:51,589
a stressful day, and I thought
you deserved something

682
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,525
with a little umbrella.
- [laughs]

683
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,627
You have no idea.
- Mm.

684
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:58,329
So how did it go?

685
00:24:58,365 --> 00:25:00,331
- It was great.
- Really?

686
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:02,433
What did he say?
- Mm.

687
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:04,280
He said I should have no issue
getting you pregnant,

688
00:25:04,304 --> 00:25:05,470
and nothing else.

689
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:06,549
- Nothing else?
- [swallows]

690
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:08,339
Absolutely not one thing else.

691
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:10,997
That's funny,
because I was told

692
00:25:10,998 --> 00:25:12,598
you have to give up mudding.
- What?

693
00:25:12,633 --> 00:25:13,810
How'd you know that?
- They called me

694
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:15,969
right after they saw you.
- I don't believe this.

695
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,173
This is a total violation
of the doctor-patient...

696
00:25:19,174 --> 00:25:21,408
Cut the bullshit, Louis.
You signed the form.

697
00:25:21,443 --> 00:25:23,910
The question is,
can you do this?

698
00:25:23,946 --> 00:25:25,779
- Of course I can do it.
- Are you sure?

699
00:25:25,814 --> 00:25:27,481
Because you couldn't even
admit it to me.

700
00:25:27,516 --> 00:25:28,560
I didn't wanna talk about it
because it was

701
00:25:28,584 --> 00:25:30,517
a difficult thing,
but I can handle it.

702
00:25:30,552 --> 00:25:32,163
You know nothing means more
to me than having a family.

703
00:25:32,187 --> 00:25:34,021
I do know that, Louis,
but I also know

704
00:25:34,056 --> 00:25:35,989
how your brain works,
and you're gonna try

705
00:25:36,025 --> 00:25:37,535
to figure out a way
to convince yourself

706
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:40,193
that you can have both.
- [scoffs]

707
00:25:40,229 --> 00:25:42,996
I am a grown man,
and I am telling you,

708
00:25:43,032 --> 00:25:44,872
if a doctor tells me
I have to give up mudding,

709
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,934
then I will give it up.
- Promise me.

710
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,671
I promise.

711
00:25:50,706 --> 00:25:53,006
[knocking on door]

712
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:02,516
[sighs]
Mom, if you're here

713
00:26:02,551 --> 00:26:03,561
to talk about Marcus...
- Of course I'm here

714
00:26:03,585 --> 00:26:05,452
to talk about Marcus.

715
00:26:05,487 --> 00:26:09,056
Question is, are you going
to let me in or not?

716
00:26:09,091 --> 00:26:10,857
Then go ahead
and say your piece,

717
00:26:10,893 --> 00:26:12,793
but it's not
gonna change my mind.

718
00:26:12,828 --> 00:26:16,697
Well, I don't know
if it will or it won't...

719
00:26:16,732 --> 00:26:18,965
but I came to tell you
you're right.

720
00:26:19,001 --> 00:26:21,034
What Marcus did was horrible,

721
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,637
and I understand
you being furious,

722
00:26:23,672 --> 00:26:25,639
but Haley's in fifth grade.

723
00:26:25,674 --> 00:26:27,307
She barely knows
what gambling is.

724
00:26:27,342 --> 00:26:28,642
She knows what lying is.

725
00:26:28,677 --> 00:26:30,977
She knows that her father
asked her to do it.

726
00:26:31,013 --> 00:26:32,713
And Marcus feels terrible
about that.

727
00:26:32,748 --> 00:26:33,958
Yeah, that's what
all addicts say.

728
00:26:33,982 --> 00:26:37,050
And your brother has never
been as strong as you are,

729
00:26:37,086 --> 00:26:38,997
but that doesn't mean...
- This isn't about strength.

730
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:41,555
No, it's about forgiveness.

731
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,157
And Marcus forgave me,
even when I failed you both,

732
00:26:44,193 --> 00:26:46,359
and then he forgave you
when you walked away.

733
00:26:46,395 --> 00:26:47,527
Are you saying I owe him?

734
00:26:47,563 --> 00:26:50,797
I'm saying
people make mistakes.

735
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:54,735
Harvey, I know
how angry you are...

736
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:57,838
but you can't let him lose
his children.

737
00:26:57,873 --> 00:27:00,741
Because I can tell you
from personal experience

738
00:27:00,776 --> 00:27:04,945
there is nothing worse
for the parent or the child.

739
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,713
What am I supposed
to say to that?

740
00:27:06,749 --> 00:27:09,816
How about if I say
what we both know is true?

741
00:27:10,753 --> 00:27:12,119
This is all my fault.

742
00:27:12,154 --> 00:27:14,087
I modeled
all of this behavior

743
00:27:14,123 --> 00:27:17,257
for both of you,
but please, Harvey,

744
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:21,128
don't make him pay
for my mistakes.

745
00:27:21,163 --> 00:27:23,730
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

746
00:27:24,733 --> 00:27:27,534
But I'm gonna need
to ask you some questions.

747
00:27:27,569 --> 00:27:29,936
So make yourself comfortable,

748
00:27:29,972 --> 00:27:33,039
because we're gonna be here
for a while.

749
00:27:42,084 --> 00:27:43,950
Thought you were done
with me.

750
00:27:43,986 --> 00:27:46,052
I'm your brother.

751
00:27:46,088 --> 00:27:49,122
I'm never gonna be done
with you.

752
00:27:49,158 --> 00:27:52,125
- You talked to Mom.
- I did.

753
00:27:52,161 --> 00:27:54,594
She basically said
it was all her fault.

754
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,197
- Well, it wasn't.
- I know.

755
00:27:57,232 --> 00:27:59,065
But if I can forgive her,
I should be able

756
00:27:59,101 --> 00:28:01,234
to forgive you too.

757
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:04,271
I figured out a way
to get you shared custody.

758
00:28:04,306 --> 00:28:06,373
But I am putting
in the agreement,

759
00:28:06,408 --> 00:28:08,408
you ever gamble again,
she gets the kids.

760
00:28:08,443 --> 00:28:11,244
You don't live up to that,
I don't care what the law says,

761
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,047
I'll represent her to make sure
that's what happens.

762
00:28:14,082 --> 00:28:16,850
- Okay.
- Okay.

763
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:25,659
Um...

764
00:28:25,694 --> 00:28:28,161
this claims that Katie's
an unfit mother.

765
00:28:28,197 --> 00:28:29,830
You were traveling for work,

766
00:28:29,865 --> 00:28:31,309
and Haley broke her arm
at the playground.

767
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:33,633
Where was Katie?
- She was in a meeting.

768
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:35,101
Her phone was off.
- So you'd think

769
00:28:35,137 --> 00:28:37,003
she'd be more mindful
in the future,

770
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,906
but when her son wandered off
from camp two years later,

771
00:28:39,942 --> 00:28:41,675
she didn't even bother
calling them back

772
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,643
for three hours.
- She didn't get the message!

773
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,012
Well, when you got
the message, you drove up there

774
00:28:46,048 --> 00:28:48,481
like a rocket to go find him.
- Harvey, you're twisting

775
00:28:48,482 --> 00:28:49,848
the facts here.
- No.

776
00:28:49,884 --> 00:28:52,045
I am getting your children.
- Not this way, you're not.

777
00:28:52,071 --> 00:28:54,672
I know this
doesn't feel good,

778
00:28:54,707 --> 00:28:56,136
but you said it:
we need a howitzer.

779
00:28:56,137 --> 00:28:57,503
This is it.
- I don't care.

780
00:28:57,538 --> 00:28:59,271
- Marcus...
- Katie is a good mother.

781
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:01,039
She loves those kids.

782
00:29:01,075 --> 00:29:02,619
I'm not gonna let you
say these things about her.

783
00:29:02,643 --> 00:29:05,043
Damn it, Marcus,
there's no other way.

784
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:07,412
You're the best goddamn
closer in New York.

785
00:29:07,448 --> 00:29:09,148
Isn't that what you always say?

786
00:29:09,183 --> 00:29:11,617
Well, the best goddamn closer
would find another way.

787
00:29:15,523 --> 00:29:16,989
Hey, Dad.

788
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:19,224
Got you some churros.

789
00:29:20,227 --> 00:29:22,194
Thanks, but I gotta say,

790
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:24,307
I thought you'd be here
an hour ago begging to go home.

791
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:27,032
Well, Samantha and I went
to Otto's Tacos to celebrate.

792
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:29,334
- Celebrate what?
- Her destroying this dude

793
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:32,104
in a deposition all because
of what I gave her.

794
00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:33,772
She said I did great.
- What do you mean,

795
00:29:33,807 --> 00:29:35,807
"what you gave her"?
- Well, I overheard this guy

796
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:38,277
telling his lawyer that
they stole our drug formula,

797
00:29:38,312 --> 00:29:39,811
and then I just...
- Wait a second,

798
00:29:39,847 --> 00:29:41,691
you overheard this?
- I didn't just overhear it,

799
00:29:41,715 --> 00:29:43,348
I recorded it.

800
00:29:43,384 --> 00:29:45,284
And then Samantha used it
in a deposition.

801
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,785
Well, she didn't
really use it,

802
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,183
she just threatened to use it,
which I thought

803
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,728
was pretty badass...
- I want you to stay

804
00:29:50,752 --> 00:29:52,719
the hell away from that woman.
- What?

805
00:29:52,754 --> 00:29:53,964
- You heard me.
- Wait, aren't you the one

806
00:29:53,988 --> 00:29:55,988
who wanted us to work together
in the first place?

807
00:29:56,024 --> 00:29:57,724
Not to work together,
keep an eye on you,

808
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:59,603
and definitely not use you.
- She didn't use me.

809
00:29:59,627 --> 00:30:00,838
I volunteered.
- You don't know what she did

810
00:30:00,862 --> 00:30:03,896
because you're 15 years old.
- Well, I may only be 15,

811
00:30:03,932 --> 00:30:06,332
but I actually came in here
to admit that I was wrong

812
00:30:06,367 --> 00:30:08,045
for not wanting to come
into work with you,

813
00:30:08,069 --> 00:30:09,702
and that now I can't wait
until tomorrow.

814
00:30:09,738 --> 00:30:11,115
Well, tomorrow's not gonna
be like today,

815
00:30:11,139 --> 00:30:13,372
because you're gonna stay away
from that woman.

816
00:30:13,408 --> 00:30:16,843
- You can't make me do that!
- You'd better believe I can.

817
00:30:22,117 --> 00:30:24,617
You really are a piece of work,
aren't you?

818
00:30:24,652 --> 00:30:26,197
I'm sorry, shouldn't you
be coming in here

819
00:30:26,221 --> 00:30:28,087
to thank me for taking care
of your daughter?

820
00:30:28,123 --> 00:30:30,389
If you think what you did
is what "taking care of" means,

821
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:32,291
I hope you never get
a goddamn house plant,

822
00:30:32,327 --> 00:30:35,061
let alone a child.
- Excuse me?

823
00:30:35,096 --> 00:30:36,763
Joy told me about
the stunt you pulled,

824
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:38,631
and how you told her
she did a great job.

825
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:40,733
Well, did you also tell her
it's illegal to record

826
00:30:40,769 --> 00:30:43,069
someone else's conversation?
- It is not illegal

827
00:30:43,104 --> 00:30:44,604
to record sound
in a public space.

828
00:30:44,639 --> 00:30:46,083
That's not what happened
and you know it.

829
00:30:46,107 --> 00:30:47,039
Well, it doesn't matter,
because I didn't use

830
00:30:47,075 --> 00:30:48,285
the recording
because I didn't need to.

831
00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:50,643
Oh, I know that,
because if you had,

832
00:30:50,678 --> 00:30:51,956
we'd have a whole other set
of problems right now.

833
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,045
And what would those be?

834
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:55,615
Because was I did
was completely within

835
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,394
the bounds of the law.
- You don't get it, do you?

836
00:30:57,418 --> 00:30:58,951
I trusted you with my daughter

837
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:00,331
who's been getting in trouble
and lying,

838
00:31:00,355 --> 00:31:02,188
and then she does something
like this.

839
00:31:02,223 --> 00:31:03,901
And instead of you telling her
it was wrong, you gave her

840
00:31:03,925 --> 00:31:05,758
a goddamn cookie.
- What I did was treat her

841
00:31:05,794 --> 00:31:07,827
like an adult and show her
how the world works.

842
00:31:07,862 --> 00:31:09,662
Well, she's not an adult,
and she can learn

843
00:31:09,697 --> 00:31:11,142
how the world works
when you and I did,

844
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,965
and that's not 15.
- Some of us learned

845
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:14,145
a hell of a lot younger
than that.

846
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:15,613
Well, you must have had
a shitty upbringing,

847
00:31:15,637 --> 00:31:18,404
because a parent's job
isn't to teach their kids

848
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:20,173
how the world is.

849
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:22,119
A parent's job is to teach them
how the world should be.

850
00:31:22,143 --> 00:31:24,410
Well, her parent asked me
to get through to her

851
00:31:24,445 --> 00:31:26,245
in the first place
because he couldn't

852
00:31:26,281 --> 00:31:28,848
do it himself.
- Well...

853
00:31:28,883 --> 00:31:30,449
that's on me to grapple with.

854
00:31:30,485 --> 00:31:32,318
In the meantime,
stay the hell away

855
00:31:32,353 --> 00:31:34,821
from my daughter.

856
00:31:39,699 --> 00:31:41,633
[elevator dings]

857
00:31:44,222 --> 00:31:45,833
Good morning, Gretchen.
How are you this...

858
00:31:45,857 --> 00:31:47,723
I'm busy, Louis,
just like you'd better get.

859
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:49,637
Which is what I'm doing here.
- Wait, slow it down.

860
00:31:49,661 --> 00:31:51,561
What are you talking about?
- The Nielson depo

861
00:31:51,596 --> 00:31:53,496
got moved up to tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

862
00:31:53,531 --> 00:31:55,743
Yes, and Joan Walsh wants
her quarterly update yesterday.

863
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:58,468
There are 16 other things
waiting for you in your office.

864
00:31:58,503 --> 00:32:00,314
You got lunch with Sheila
at 1:00, and I don't know

865
00:32:00,338 --> 00:32:01,649
what the hell...
- Stop right there.

866
00:32:01,673 --> 00:32:02,572
You need to reschedule half
of those things.

867
00:32:02,607 --> 00:32:04,373
That brings me
to the last thing:

868
00:32:04,409 --> 00:32:06,409
I gotta go to the dentist.
- What?

869
00:32:06,444 --> 00:32:08,478
Gretchen, no,
you can't leave me like this.

870
00:32:08,513 --> 00:32:09,779
Did you hear me?

871
00:32:09,814 --> 00:32:12,582
I got a hole in my tooth
the size of Colorado.

872
00:32:12,617 --> 00:32:14,650
And before you ask me
to call Lipschitz

873
00:32:14,686 --> 00:32:16,385
because you can't handle
the pressure,

874
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:18,087
he's out of town
till next week.

875
00:32:18,122 --> 00:32:20,590
Good luck.

876
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:22,391
Good mudding, Louis.

877
00:32:22,427 --> 00:32:24,371
- Good mudding, Louis.
- Hey, Louis, good mudding.

878
00:32:24,395 --> 00:32:27,230
And good mudding to you.
- Top of the mudding to you.

879
00:32:27,265 --> 00:32:28,764
- Good mudding.
- Good mudding.

880
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,532
[echoing]
- Good mudding.

881
00:32:29,567 --> 00:32:30,867
Hey, Louis, good mudding.

882
00:32:30,902 --> 00:32:32,635
<i>Mudding...mudding...</i>

883
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:46,249
So what's on the agenda
for today?

884
00:32:46,284 --> 00:32:48,384
Nothing.

885
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:49,930
After last night's lecture,
I didn't think

886
00:32:49,954 --> 00:32:52,188
I'd be seeing you today.
- Yeah, well, my dad told me

887
00:32:52,223 --> 00:32:53,289
to stay away from you,

888
00:32:53,324 --> 00:32:54,590
but he doesn't know anything.

889
00:32:54,626 --> 00:32:56,559
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

890
00:32:56,594 --> 00:32:58,861
He's an asshole.
- Don't say that.

891
00:32:58,897 --> 00:33:00,696
Why not?
It's the truth.

892
00:33:00,732 --> 00:33:03,199
I learned more from you
than any adult ever,

893
00:33:03,234 --> 00:33:05,101
so if he wants me
to stay away from you,

894
00:33:05,136 --> 00:33:07,537
he's wrong.
- No...

895
00:33:07,572 --> 00:33:10,072
Joy, he's not.

896
00:33:10,108 --> 00:33:12,542
I'm the one who was wrong.

897
00:33:12,577 --> 00:33:15,311
That car I boosted
when I was 14?

898
00:33:15,346 --> 00:33:17,580
I didn't tell you
the other half of it.

899
00:33:17,615 --> 00:33:20,249
I didn't just get suspended;
I got expelled.

900
00:33:20,285 --> 00:33:21,584
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

901
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:24,554
And after that, I had a choice:
either get my shit together

902
00:33:24,589 --> 00:33:26,622
or get nowhere in life.

903
00:33:26,658 --> 00:33:30,493
So by the time I was a senior,
I got a scholarship and...

904
00:33:30,528 --> 00:33:31,494
that's how I was able
to go to college

905
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:32,895
in the first place.

906
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:34,931
Well, I don't need
a scholarship. My dad's rich.

907
00:33:34,966 --> 00:33:37,567
And if you think that's
your father's value,

908
00:33:37,602 --> 00:33:40,570
you don't know anything.

909
00:33:40,605 --> 00:33:41,837
Whether you see it or not,

910
00:33:41,873 --> 00:33:43,005
he is looking out for you.

911
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:44,251
He doesn't look out
for me, okay?

912
00:33:44,275 --> 00:33:46,353
He just tells me what to do.
- Telling you what to do

913
00:33:46,377 --> 00:33:48,144
is looking out for you.

914
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:49,823
As someone who didn't
have anyone telling me

915
00:33:49,847 --> 00:33:53,249
what to do when I could have
really used it...

916
00:33:53,284 --> 00:33:56,118
you have no idea
how lucky you are.

917
00:33:56,154 --> 00:33:57,587
So whether you want

918
00:33:57,622 --> 00:33:59,322
to listen to him or not, I do,

919
00:33:59,357 --> 00:34:02,592
and we're not
working together anymore.

920
00:34:02,627 --> 00:34:04,527
I didn't think
you'd take his side.

921
00:34:04,562 --> 00:34:07,330
What can I say, turns out
your father's pretty smart.

922
00:34:07,365 --> 00:34:10,366
You should listen to him
sometime.

923
00:34:10,401 --> 00:34:11,534
Maybe I will.

924
00:34:11,569 --> 00:34:13,869
I mean, he was right
about one thing this week...

925
00:34:13,905 --> 00:34:15,638
Yeah? What's that?

926
00:34:15,673 --> 00:34:17,607
You are the cool one.

927
00:34:17,642 --> 00:34:20,476
Joy, what I'm trying
to tell you...

928
00:34:20,511 --> 00:34:23,779
is I think maybe your dad
is the cool one.

929
00:34:34,025 --> 00:34:35,858
- Mind if I sit?
- Harvey, I told you,

930
00:34:35,893 --> 00:34:38,394
I'm not talking to you
without my lawyer.

931
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:40,830
And I tried to tell you
that lawyers

932
00:34:40,865 --> 00:34:42,999
only make things ugly.

933
00:34:43,034 --> 00:34:45,568
Here's proof.

934
00:34:45,603 --> 00:34:48,404
- What is this?
- It's a list of all the times

935
00:34:48,439 --> 00:34:49,672
you put those kids at risk.

936
00:34:49,707 --> 00:34:53,309
- This is bullshit.
- Maybe, but it's the kind

937
00:34:53,344 --> 00:34:55,244
of bullshit that works
in court.

938
00:34:55,279 --> 00:34:57,591
- You wouldn't do this to me.
- You'd better believe I would,

939
00:34:57,615 --> 00:34:58,981
because I care
about those kids,

940
00:34:59,017 --> 00:35:02,018
and I know they both need you
and Marcus in their lives.

941
00:35:02,053 --> 00:35:03,931
Well, then maybe Marcus
should have thought about that

942
00:35:03,955 --> 00:35:06,689
before he did what he did.
- Yeah, he should have.

943
00:35:06,724 --> 00:35:08,057
But he's thinking about it now,

944
00:35:08,092 --> 00:35:11,794
which is why as much
as I'd like to use this...

945
00:35:12,864 --> 00:35:15,031
He won't let me.
- What?

946
00:35:15,066 --> 00:35:17,733
I told him this
was the only way.

947
00:35:17,769 --> 00:35:19,780
He told me to find another one
because he doesn't want

948
00:35:19,804 --> 00:35:21,971
to hurt you any more
than he already has.

949
00:35:24,075 --> 00:35:26,575
Katie...

950
00:35:26,611 --> 00:35:29,278
he loves you...

951
00:35:29,313 --> 00:35:30,880
and whether or not
you're willing

952
00:35:30,915 --> 00:35:33,783
to give the marriage
another chance...

953
00:35:33,818 --> 00:35:36,886
he deserves another chance
as a father.

954
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,623
I never thought I'd hear
something like that

955
00:35:40,658 --> 00:35:42,358
from Harvey Specter.

956
00:35:42,393 --> 00:35:45,461
Well, if there's one thing
I've come around on,

957
00:35:45,496 --> 00:35:47,463
when it comes to family,
forgiveness

958
00:35:47,498 --> 00:35:49,665
is a hell of a lot better
than anger.

959
00:35:51,969 --> 00:35:54,603
I'll think about it.

960
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:57,540
That's the most I can ask.

961
00:36:11,489 --> 00:36:14,390
- Hey.
- Louis, it's past 3:00.

962
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:16,292
We were supposed to go to lunch
two hours ago.

963
00:36:16,327 --> 00:36:18,561
I know.
Work was a shit-show

964
00:36:18,596 --> 00:36:20,496
so I--I got you these

965
00:36:20,531 --> 00:36:23,599
to say I'm sorry.
- Oh...

966
00:36:23,634 --> 00:36:24,734
they're beautiful.

967
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:26,669
And I have a gift for you too.
- Oh, yeah?

968
00:36:26,704 --> 00:36:28,437
What kind of gift?
- The best kind.

969
00:36:28,473 --> 00:36:30,072
You don't have
to give up mudding

970
00:36:30,108 --> 00:36:31,974
because I've decided
to get my tubes tied.

971
00:36:32,009 --> 00:36:33,676
What?
Why would you...?

972
00:36:33,711 --> 00:36:35,122
Because clearly mudding
is more important to you

973
00:36:35,146 --> 00:36:37,012
than having a baby,
so I thought,

974
00:36:37,048 --> 00:36:38,748
"Why not make it easier
for both of us?"

975
00:36:38,783 --> 00:36:40,583
- Sheila, that's not...
- You're gonna tell me

976
00:36:40,618 --> 00:36:42,818
that's not mud
under your fingernails?

977
00:36:43,788 --> 00:36:46,422
All right, it is--
but it was just one last time.

978
00:36:46,457 --> 00:36:47,468
And how can I trust
that that's true?

979
00:36:47,492 --> 00:36:48,958
Because I just told you,

980
00:36:48,993 --> 00:36:51,494
work was fucking crazy.

981
00:36:51,529 --> 00:36:53,529
Gretchen was coming at me
with 1,000 things.

982
00:36:53,564 --> 00:36:54,775
You don't understand.
- I do understand,

983
00:36:54,799 --> 00:36:57,900
because I'm the one
who asked her to come at you.

984
00:37:00,705 --> 00:37:02,538
So let me just
get this straight:

985
00:37:02,573 --> 00:37:04,673
you didn't trust me,
so you did this to me.

986
00:37:04,709 --> 00:37:07,676
No, I didn't do anything
to you.

987
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,178
You made me a promise.

988
00:37:09,213 --> 00:37:11,013
All you had to do was let go
of one thing,

989
00:37:11,048 --> 00:37:12,960
and you couldn't do it.
- Well, it was a big thing,

990
00:37:12,984 --> 00:37:14,850
and I don't even know
if it's the only thing.

991
00:37:14,886 --> 00:37:17,887
Now, let me
get this straight:

992
00:37:17,922 --> 00:37:20,990
you can't put the needs
of our child...

993
00:37:21,025 --> 00:37:22,958
above your own.
- I'm not saying that.

994
00:37:22,994 --> 00:37:24,171
Okay, then what
are you saying?

995
00:37:24,195 --> 00:37:25,372
Because I may not be
a mother yet, but I know

996
00:37:25,396 --> 00:37:28,497
that's what parenthood means--
- So do I.

997
00:37:28,533 --> 00:37:30,199
Then what happens
the first time he's sick

998
00:37:30,234 --> 00:37:31,600
when we have tickets
to the ballet?

999
00:37:31,636 --> 00:37:33,903
Or there's a deposition
at the same time

1000
00:37:33,938 --> 00:37:34,804
as a parent-teacher conference?

1001
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:36,105
- Those are different.
- How?

1002
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,818
Because I would be
giving those things up for him,

1003
00:37:37,842 --> 00:37:39,575
not for...

1004
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,477
For me.

1005
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:43,712
No, you're not giving
any of it up for me.

1006
00:37:43,748 --> 00:37:46,582
You're giving these things up
to have a child.

1007
00:37:46,617 --> 00:37:47,928
Do you want to know
what I'm giving up?

1008
00:37:47,952 --> 00:37:49,652
Coffee...

1009
00:37:49,687 --> 00:37:51,220
and drinking...

1010
00:37:51,255 --> 00:37:53,222
and cheese,
and my hair color--

1011
00:37:53,257 --> 00:37:55,991
not to mention the pain
of pushing another human being

1012
00:37:56,027 --> 00:37:57,860

1013
00:37:57,895 --> 00:37:59,706
So if you're not ready to make
this one little sacrifice,

1014
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,530
then you're not ready...

1015
00:38:01,566 --> 00:38:03,899
to have a child.

1016
00:38:07,805 --> 00:38:10,506
Sheila, I'm sorry.

1017
00:38:11,776 --> 00:38:14,243
I wasn't thinking,
and I won't--I won't--

1018
00:38:14,278 --> 00:38:16,111
I'll just get rid
of my membership today.

1019
00:38:16,147 --> 00:38:19,114
No, you don't have to give up
your membership, Louis.

1020
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,116
You just have to stop
till we get pregnant.

1021
00:38:21,152 --> 00:38:22,718
Don't you see?

1022
00:38:22,753 --> 00:38:24,520
If I keep it...

1023
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:27,056
I'll be tempted.

1024
00:38:27,091 --> 00:38:29,592
Sheila, having a family
is far more important to me

1025
00:38:29,627 --> 00:38:31,794
than going mudding.

1026
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:33,195
Okay, good.

[phone vibrating]

1028
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:45,140
Let me guess:
you fixed everything,

1029
00:38:45,176 --> 00:38:46,609
and you're calling me
to tell Robert

1030
00:38:46,644 --> 00:38:48,444
that you'll be back
in the morning.

1031
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:49,445
<i>Okay, mind reader.</i>

1032
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,047
What do I have to say to that?

1033
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:54,483
I don't know, Harvey, but...

1034
00:38:54,518 --> 00:38:55,951
I'm glad you went.

1035
00:38:55,987 --> 00:38:57,820
To tell you the truth...

1036
00:38:57,855 --> 00:38:58,966
it was one
of the hardest things

1037
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:01,056
I've ever had to do.

1038
00:39:01,092 --> 00:39:02,958
I swear it took
a piece of me, Donna.

1039
00:39:02,994 --> 00:39:05,661
Well, you could look at it
that way,

1040
00:39:05,696 --> 00:39:07,997
or you could look at it
like you chose

1041
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,665
to give a piece of yourself.

1042
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,066
That's pretty good.

1043
00:39:11,102 --> 00:39:12,668
You should be a philosopher.

1044
00:39:12,703 --> 00:39:15,738
And who's to say I'm not?

1045
00:39:15,773 --> 00:39:17,840
Oh, now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to give a piece

1046

1047
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,744
Thank you, Donna.

1048
00:39:30,821 --> 00:39:33,989
Donna, no offense,
but a cup of coffee

1049
00:39:34,025 --> 00:39:35,858
is the last thing
I need right now.

1050
00:39:35,893 --> 00:39:37,960
Among other things,
I'm trying to give up caffeine.

1051
00:39:37,995 --> 00:39:41,130
I know that, Louis...

1052
00:39:41,165 --> 00:39:44,600
and that's not coffee.

1053
00:39:46,337 --> 00:39:47,703
Oh, my God,
don't tell me it's...

- Sheila told you

1057
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,810
I sold my membership,
didn't she?

1058
00:39:54,845 --> 00:39:55,778
She did, and I have to say
I think that's

1059
00:39:55,813 --> 00:39:59,114
the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

1060
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,349
Thanks, Donna.

1061
00:40:00,384 --> 00:40:02,117
And thanks for this.

1062
00:40:02,153 --> 00:40:03,819
One more thing.

1063
00:40:03,854 --> 00:40:05,332
Something tells me
that you're gonna need this

1064
00:40:05,356 --> 00:40:08,624
for coffee
sooner than you think.

1065
00:40:11,195 --> 00:40:12,628
Good night, Louis.
