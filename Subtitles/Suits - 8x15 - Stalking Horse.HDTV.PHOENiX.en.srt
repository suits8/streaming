1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,405
<i>Previously on "Suits"...</i>

2
00:00:01,406 --> 00:00:03,540
Get on the ground.
Wallet and phone.

3
00:00:05,145 --> 00:00:06,377
You weren't there!

4
00:00:06,604 --> 00:00:08,971
You don't know the shit
I went through!

5
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:12,474
The same thing that happened
to you happened to me.

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,642
Are you sure the two of us

7
00:00:13,678 --> 00:00:15,944
working so closely together
is a good idea?

8
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,479
<i>It might get complicated.</i>

9
00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:18,881
It's not fair that
my reputation

10
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,627
in this firm takes a hit
when you are the one--

11
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:23,519
- I was the one that what?
- Where have you been?

12
00:00:23,554 --> 00:00:25,154
I've been looking
for you all morning.

13
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:26,889
Hey, if you must know,
I overslept.

14
00:00:26,924 --> 00:00:28,590
I'd love to go out again,
Thomas.

15
00:00:28,626 --> 00:00:29,936
- Is tonight too soon?
- Let me check my calendar.

16
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,694
- Yep, I'm free.
- I have an idea.

17
00:00:31,729 --> 00:00:34,563
If we work together for a year
and it's successful,

18
00:00:34,598 --> 00:00:36,432
you'll be
on the junior partner track.

19
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:38,233
That sounds like a plan.

20
00:00:38,269 --> 00:00:40,869
- Harvey, this is Thomas.
- Kessler. We've met.

21
00:00:48,545 --> 00:00:50,212
Here's another one. Oh.

22
00:00:50,247 --> 00:00:52,080
Your grandmother did not

23
00:00:52,115 --> 00:00:55,450
want to go to the beach
in Nice, but I insisted.

24
00:00:55,485 --> 00:00:58,820
Oh, my God, Mom, you were hot.

25
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,574
Donna, please.
I was smokin' hot.

26
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,544
Well, if you got it, admit it.

27
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:07,313
Sweetie, I really appreciate
you indulging me.

28
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:10,116
It's always nice to look back
at this trip but...

29
00:01:10,152 --> 00:01:12,285
it's just so much more fun
with you.

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,355
I'm not indulging you, Mom.
I love it, too.

31
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,826
Then what do you say
we make an album of our own.

32
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:22,028
- What do you mean?
- The last few years

33
00:01:22,064 --> 00:01:23,897
have been tight,
but I've been saving up.

34
00:01:23,932 --> 00:01:26,699
And you and I
are going to Paris

35
00:01:26,735 --> 00:01:29,803
for two weeks,
right after you graduate.

36
00:01:29,838 --> 00:01:32,605
- You're kidding.
- I am 100% not kidding.

37
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:34,956
Mom, this is amazing.

38
00:01:34,957 --> 00:01:36,456
I wanna see it all.

39
00:01:36,492 --> 00:01:39,493
Notre Dame, the Louvre,
the cafés.

40
00:01:39,528 --> 00:01:40,839
Do you really think
we can do all that?

41
00:01:40,863 --> 00:01:42,729
We can do anything you want

42
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:44,965
because I finally understand
why that trip

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,601
was so special
for my mom.

44
00:01:47,636 --> 00:01:49,903
And now I get to have
all that with you.

45
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:57,533
Okay, just the way you like
it, vanilla with two splashes

46
00:01:57,568 --> 00:01:59,516
of "why would anyone
want their coffee this sweet"?

47
00:01:59,517 --> 00:02:01,684
You seem particularly happy
this morning.

48
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,053
- I am.
- Any reason?

49
00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:05,399
Other than the fact that you
woke up

50
00:02:05,423 --> 00:02:08,591
next to this 5"9 stack
of fantastic?

51
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:10,660
As a matter of fact, there is.

52
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:12,662
Um, do you remember
that meeting

53
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:14,217
I had to leave early
for the other day?

54
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:17,151
You mean the morning
after our first time

55
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:18,864
when you snuck out of here
like you robbed a bank?

56
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,722
You know, funny you should
say that, because...

57
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:24,025
I feel like I robbed a bank
this morning.

58
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,627
What do you mean?

59
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:30,231
Well, we've been negotiating
to expand our retail presence.

60
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:34,368
We were at an impasse, and now
we're full steam ahead.

61
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,938
- Thomas, that's fantastic.
- It is.

62
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:39,474
It's gonna take us
to a whole other level.

63
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:42,743
But the real reason I'm so
happy is that there isn't

64
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:45,046
anyone I'd rather share
this with than you.

65
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,251
There he is,
the man himself,

66
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:52,787
the Babe Ruth
of the legal profession.

67
00:02:52,822 --> 00:02:54,555
Flatter me all you want,
Simon.

68
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,924
You got me over here at 8:00,
and I don't even like

69
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,926
to be up at 8:00,
so what do you got?

70
00:02:58,962 --> 00:03:00,595
The answer to
our tenant problems.

71
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,665
I'm assuming you mean
Restoration

72
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:03,965
pulling out of the deal.
- I do.

73
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:07,135
I've invited someone else
to take their seat.

74
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,104
- Who's that?
- Thomas Kessler Furniture.

75
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:11,106
They're up and coming,
they're about to sign

76
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:15,010
a huge deal with my major
competitor, and I want them.

77
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:17,412
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Is there a problem?

78
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:21,483
Simon, aside from the fact
that we represent Kessler,

79
00:03:21,518 --> 00:03:23,785
which is a conflict,

80
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,609
I can get
Restoration back to the table.

81
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,476
I don't want them
back at the table.

82
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:30,078
- But I thought we--
- Harvey, think about it.

83
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:33,481
They're a national chain,
they're flush with cash,

84
00:03:33,516 --> 00:03:36,150
and we can only build
so many malls.

85
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:37,296
Which means
if we're gonna increase

86
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,486
our revenue going forward--

87
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:41,222
You need up and coming
tenants who will trade

88
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:43,357
a piece of the upside
for a break on rent.

89
00:03:43,393 --> 00:03:45,726
Welcome to the conversation.

90
00:03:45,762 --> 00:03:46,894
Okay, Simon.

91
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:49,697
Yet, I still feel
you're checking your swings,

92
00:03:49,732 --> 00:03:52,033
so what's your concern?

93
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:55,970
No concern.
You want Kessler, you got 'em.

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,114
Louis, this is so much fun.

95
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:01,916
I'm so glad
we're finally doing this.

96
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:03,527
Of course, Sheila,
when I told you

97
00:04:03,528 --> 00:04:06,429
that our baby
comes first, I meant it.

98
00:04:06,465 --> 00:04:09,265
And speaking of coming first,

99
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:11,000
imagine our little love bug

100
00:04:11,036 --> 00:04:12,380
rolling to the playground
in this bad boy.

101
00:04:12,404 --> 00:04:14,170
- Wait, is this--
- Yup.

102
00:04:14,206 --> 00:04:15,605
"Paternity Magazine"'s
top pick.

103
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,141
Yeah, and it's also $2,000.

104
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:20,210
Louis, can we really ask people
to buy this for us?

105
00:04:20,245 --> 00:04:21,611
Sheila, let me explain
something to you.

106
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:23,245
All of our friends
are rich,

107
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:25,514
and as any rich person will
tell you,

108
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,850
gifts are the truest form
of love.

109
00:04:27,885 --> 00:04:29,885
So in other words,
scan that mofo.

110
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:31,887
Scan the shit
out of that bad boy.

111
00:04:34,258 --> 00:04:35,324
Hello?

112
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,660
<i>- Louis Litt?</i>
- Yeah, this is.

113
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:38,994
This is Detective Bukowski,

114
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,864
was your wallet stolen
recently?

115
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:44,700
Yeah, it was.
How could you possibly know--

116
00:04:44,736 --> 00:04:48,170
We believe we may just have
arrested the man who stole it.

117
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:50,339
- Oh, my God.
<i>- Would you be willing to</i>

118
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:53,776
come down here
and identify him in a lineup?

119
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:55,289
Sir, I can assure you
he won't see you.

120
00:04:55,313 --> 00:04:56,946
He won't even know who you are.

121
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:58,447
Yeah, I'll come right down.

122
00:04:58,483 --> 00:05:00,750
Just let me know
where you're at.

123
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:01,719

Mr. Litt,
do you recognize anyone?

140
00:06:02,735 --> 00:06:04,735
Number six.

141
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,770
Number six, step forward.

142
00:06:11,277 --> 00:06:14,978
Are you sure?
We need you to be sure.

143
00:06:15,014 --> 00:06:17,881
- Wallet and phone.
- It's him, I'm sure.

144
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:21,018
Good, we appreciate
the cooperation.

145
00:06:21,053 --> 00:06:23,120
The DA's office will be
in touch about testifying.

146
00:06:23,155 --> 00:06:25,589
Testifying? I thought
I just had to identify him.

147
00:06:25,624 --> 00:06:27,524
But you also said
you were assaulted.

148
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,237
Unless you want to let him
plead to a misdemeanor,

149
00:06:29,261 --> 00:06:30,561
you need to appear in court.

150
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,630
Yeah, of course.

151
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,532
Take the rest of 'em out.

152
00:06:39,894 --> 00:06:41,960
- Alex, you got a second?
- Actually, Harvey,

153
00:06:41,996 --> 00:06:43,962
I'm running a two-minute drill
right now, so no.

154
00:06:43,998 --> 00:06:46,165
Well, I need you to take
a look at this anyway.

155
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,167
What is it?

156
00:06:48,523 --> 00:06:50,456
Simon Lowe wants
Thomas Kessler

157
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:52,258
to be their anchor
in 20 new malls.

158
00:06:52,293 --> 00:06:54,427
Well, I'm sorry to say,
that's my two-minute drill,

159
00:06:54,462 --> 00:06:55,663
and I'm at the one-yard line

160
00:06:55,664 --> 00:06:57,097
with another mall owner.
- So?

161
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:59,566
So I haven't known Thomas
long but I know he doesn't like

162
00:06:59,602 --> 00:07:01,530
to deal in bad faith.
- This isn't bad faith, Alex.

163
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,964
He didn't even know
this deal was coming,

164
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:06,423
and he sure as hell didn't know
how good it would be.

165
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,704
- Good or not, it's a conflict.
- Take a look at the offer,

166
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:11,328
then tell me
he won't wave conflict.

167
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:15,232
Damn.

168
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:18,202
A 50% haircut on rent
for 10% of our gross?

169
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,269
These guys are serious.

170
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,438
Pretty sure it beats
whatever you got cooking.

171
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,407
- How'd you come up with this?
- I didn't.

172
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:25,342
- My client did.
- I don't believe it.

173
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,111
I've been busting my ass
for months on this

174
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,879
and your client comes to you
with this.

175
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:30,981
Shit just falls out of the sky
for you, doesn't it?

176
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:32,894
You don't wanna know what
high school was like for me.

177
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:34,685
No, sir,
I do not.

178
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,019
All right, I'll take it to him,

179
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:37,432
but we better get them
in a room fast

180
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:39,167
because Thomas isn't going
to pull out of his deal

181
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:40,691
without looking Simon
in the eye

182
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,659
and seeing he's for real.

183
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,430
You wanted to see me?

184
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:49,400
Yes, in fact,
I have a present for you.

185
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,469
Your first client.

186
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,704
I don't understand.

187
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:54,750
Brian, if we're going
to follow through

188
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,541
on you being promoted
and working on your own,

189
00:07:57,576 --> 00:07:59,343
we need to do this.

190
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:00,778
Right?

191
00:08:01,616 --> 00:08:03,282
You're right.
Who's the client?

192
00:08:03,318 --> 00:08:05,218
Bespoke Handbags.

193
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:07,353
Their landlord found out
they use ammonia,

194
00:08:07,388 --> 00:08:09,166
they never disclosed it,
and they're being kicked

195
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,764
out of their building.
- That's bullshit.

196
00:08:10,765 --> 00:08:13,232
This is just a ploy because
they found a new tenant.

197
00:08:13,268 --> 00:08:14,412
And what are you going
to do about it

198
00:08:14,436 --> 00:08:16,569
because they have us
on a technicality

199
00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:18,307
and they know it.
- I'm gonna figure out

200
00:08:18,308 --> 00:08:20,148
who the new tenant is
and try to stop it.

201
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:22,388
Thus proving yourself worthy
of this client.

202
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:25,022
Except there are thousands
of potential tenants out there.

203
00:08:25,023 --> 00:08:26,556
How am I gonna figure out
who it is?

204
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:28,457
That, good sir,
is your problem.

205
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:32,161
No, it isn't.
It's ours.

206
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:33,796
Brian, the whole point

207
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:35,298
of this with--
- Here me out.

208
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,900
Remember that algorithm
you used to determine

209
00:08:37,936 --> 00:08:40,069
who should stay
and who should be fired?

210
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:41,804
Of course.
PATTIE.

211
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:43,356
Well, if you could
use it for that--

212
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,324
I can alter it for this.
Okay.

213
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:49,425
Though you realize
this still means

214
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:51,728
we're working together.
- With one key difference:

215
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:52,962
You're working for me,

216
00:08:52,998 --> 00:08:54,898
and I don't tolerate slackers,

217
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:56,733
so have that shit ready
by 10:00 tomorrow.

218
00:08:56,768 --> 00:08:58,735
I got a case to win.

219
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:06,042
- Donna.
- Harvey.

220
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:07,188
I wanna talk to you
about last night.

221
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:09,546
You mean LeBron's game winner
against the Nicks?

222
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:11,381
You know what I mean.

223
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,983
I wanna talk to you about me
seeing Thomas,

224
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:16,052
and the truth is,
I told Louis

225
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:17,720
and I meant to tell you, but--

226
00:09:18,044 --> 00:09:20,044
Donna, you don't have
to tell me every time

227
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:22,446
you start seeing a client.
- That's the thing.

228
00:09:22,481 --> 00:09:24,226
I don't just want to tell you
because he's a client.

229
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,016
I wanted to tell you
because,

230
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:30,087
even though it's really early
on, I--I really like him.

231
00:09:30,122 --> 00:09:33,691
Donna, if you really
like him, I am happy for you.

232
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:36,260
You're never gonna believe
this, but--

233
00:09:36,854 --> 00:09:38,888
I got a proposal for him
from Simon Lowe.

234
00:09:38,923 --> 00:09:41,257
They want him to be
their home goods anchor.

235
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:42,591
Well, that's incredible,
but--

236
00:09:42,627 --> 00:09:44,593
The other deal, I know.

237
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:46,195
I spoke to Alex about it

238
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,330
and he agreed,
this one's better,

239
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:50,299
and we set up a meeting
for them tonight.

240
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:52,067
Thank you,
Harvey.

241
00:09:52,103 --> 00:09:54,804
I wish I could take credit
for it, but it wasn't my idea.

242
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:58,640
No, I mean,
thank you for understanding.

243
00:09:58,675 --> 00:10:01,976
And as far as the deal goes,
credit or not,

244
00:10:02,012 --> 00:10:04,245
Thomas's business means
everything to him

245
00:10:04,281 --> 00:10:06,981
so I really appreciate it.

246
00:10:09,352 --> 00:10:11,631
All right, I got a situation.
I need to talk to you about it.

247
00:10:11,655 --> 00:10:13,054
What kind of situation?

248
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,328
That scum bag who mugged me?
They just arrested him.

249
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:18,440
They called me down to ID him,
but that wasn't enough.

250
00:10:18,464 --> 00:10:20,242
Now they want me to get
on the stand and point

251
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:21,643
the finger at him.
- Louis, what are you saying?

252
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,278
- You want me to go with you?
- I'm saying I want you

253
00:10:23,302 --> 00:10:25,036
to tell me
that it's okay not to go.

254
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:26,937
I'm sorry,
but I can't do that.

255
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:28,472
- Why the hell not?
- Because...

256
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:31,742
I get that you're scared, but
if you don't take the stand,

257
00:10:31,778 --> 00:10:34,278
no amount of self defense
is gonna take that fear away.

258
00:10:34,313 --> 00:10:35,958
The only thing that can
is confronting him.

259
00:10:35,982 --> 00:10:37,014
You don't understand.

260
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,109
When I saw him, I was right
back in that alley.

261
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,443
Trust me,
no one gets that more than me.

262
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:46,247
But I promise, if you do this,
I will be with you

263
00:10:46,282 --> 00:10:48,015
every step of the way.

264
00:10:53,077 --> 00:10:57,279
Alex, this is Simon Lowe.
And of course, Simon?

265
00:10:57,314 --> 00:10:58,513
Thomas Kessler.

266
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:00,449
I've been a fan of your work
for a long time.

267
00:11:00,484 --> 00:11:01,717
I recognize that table.

268
00:11:01,752 --> 00:11:04,019
I hope to have more just like
that anchoring my malls.

269
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:05,787
- Shall we?
- Mm-hmm.

270
00:11:05,823 --> 00:11:08,423
Look, I won't lie,
I'm intrigued by your offer,

271
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,693
but you're asking me to back
out of a deal at the 11th hour,

272
00:11:11,729 --> 00:11:13,795
and I need to know that I'm not
just a backup plan.

273
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:15,764
Well, then I won't lie
to you either.

274
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,466
If the other deal hadn't run
into trouble,

275
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:18,545
you wouldn't be here,
but it did,

276
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:21,269
and there were 15 companies
I could've gone to

277
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,016
that weren't about to close
a deal with someone else

278
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,606
but I chose you.

279
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:26,108
'Cause I believe in you.

280
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,320
Thomas, I don't take
your relationship

281
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:29,845
with our firm lightly,
so believe me when I tell you

282
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,913
this is a good offer
and I stand behind it.

283
00:11:33,217 --> 00:11:35,250
Then gentlemen, I'd say
we have ourselves a deal,

284
00:11:35,285 --> 00:11:38,153
With one stipulation: When
my client commits, he commits,

285
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:40,527
so we need to know you're gonna
follow through on this.

286
00:11:40,528 --> 00:11:42,706
Well, Alex, we had a feeling
you'd say something like that,

287
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,032
which is why we're prepared
to issue a press release

288
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:47,967
tomorrow morning announcing
the whole thing.

289
00:11:48,002 --> 00:11:50,536
You would do that even before
we ironed out the fine print?

290
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:52,171
Well, that stuffs
for the lawyers, huh?

291
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:53,806
We're businessmen.

292
00:11:53,842 --> 00:11:56,108
And if you're who I think
you are

293
00:11:56,144 --> 00:11:58,044
a handshake
is enough for me.

294
00:12:03,995 --> 00:12:06,964
Let's try this again.
What happened that night?

295
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:12,394
He pulled a gun on me,
forced me into the alley,

296
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:15,262
then stole my wallet
and my phone.

297
00:12:15,298 --> 00:12:16,931
Did he hurt you?

298
00:12:16,966 --> 00:12:19,300
Yes,
the assailant hurt me.

299
00:12:19,335 --> 00:12:21,335
Louis,
we have been over this.

300
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:23,571
Facts don't affect juries
the way feelings do.

301
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:26,354
You have to share
your pain with them.

302
00:12:26,355 --> 00:12:28,022
- I can't.
- I know you think that, but--

303
00:12:28,057 --> 00:12:29,801
You don't know, because
you've never had to let

304
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:31,562
someone see what he did to you.

305
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:34,831
How he made you helpless
and scared like a child.

306
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:36,444
Louis, have you ever asked
one of your clients

307
00:12:36,468 --> 00:12:37,545
to hide their pain?
- Of course not.

308
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:39,480
- But this is different.
- The only difference is

309
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:41,271
now you're the client.
- Goddamnit, Samantha!

310
00:12:41,306 --> 00:12:42,505
Don't you think I know that?

311
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,674
All right, that's enough.

312
00:12:45,017 --> 00:12:47,518
Look at me.
If you don't put him away,

313
00:12:47,704 --> 00:12:50,271
he will haunt you
for the rest of your life.

314
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:53,608
You are doing this so you won't
ever have to be afraid again.

315
00:12:53,643 --> 00:12:56,678
So do not be afraid
of your emotions now.

316
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:04,819
When he pointed
the gun at me...

317
00:13:07,624 --> 00:13:09,657
It was...

318
00:13:09,693 --> 00:13:12,694
I had never been
more afraid in my life.

319
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:15,764
And then he forced me
into the alley.

320
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:18,233
And then he made me
get on the ground.

321
00:13:18,268 --> 00:13:21,336
Then he pressed the gun
in the back of my head.

322
00:13:21,371 --> 00:13:24,272
He demanded my wallet
and my phone.

323
00:13:24,307 --> 00:13:28,343
But I only gave him my wallet
because my phone had

324
00:13:28,378 --> 00:13:30,979
pictures of my fiancé on it.

325
00:13:31,014 --> 00:13:32,480
So I...

326
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:37,051
I begged him to let me keep it.

327
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:39,354
I mean, there was $1,000
in the wallet.

328
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:41,656
Wasn't that enough?

329
00:13:41,691 --> 00:13:44,959
But he said that he would say
when it was enough.

330
00:13:46,513 --> 00:13:48,480
Then he kicked me.

331
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:50,126
All I could think about
was the woman I love

332
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,194
and the baby that we were
never gonna have

333
00:13:51,218 --> 00:13:52,699
because I was gonna die
in that alley.

334
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:55,183
Mr. Litt, is the man
who did that to you

335
00:13:55,218 --> 00:13:56,818
in this room right now?

336
00:13:56,853 --> 00:13:59,020
Yeah,
he's sitting right there.

337
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:02,523
Thank you,
Mr. Litt.

338
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,358
Your cross.

339
00:14:04,394 --> 00:14:06,372
We have no need to cross
Your Honor because everything

340
00:14:06,396 --> 00:14:08,396
Mr. Litt
just said is irrelevant.

341
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,164
What?

342
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,633
Your honor, the date on the
warrant doesn't match the date

343
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:15,470
of the search therefore all
the evidence against my client

344
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:18,272
is inadmissible and I move
for charges to be dismissed.

345
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:19,974
What--wait,
but he can't do that.

346
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:22,043
- He's guilty.
- Mr. Litt, I'm sorry.

347
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:23,244
The search was illegal.

348
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,913
By order of the court,
the defendant is free to go.

349
00:14:31,484 --> 00:14:33,183
Harvey, I gotta say,

350
00:14:33,219 --> 00:14:34,859
that was an impressive display
last night.

351
00:14:34,887 --> 00:14:36,654
Damn straight it was.

352
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:38,289
Listen, did you get
the paperwork

353
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:40,391
I sent over this morning?
<i>- Yeah, I did.</i>

354
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:42,159
<i>I hate to waste</i>
<i>everyone's time,</i>

355
00:14:42,194 --> 00:14:44,061
<i>but I won't be signing it.</i>

356
00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:45,696
Why the hell not?

357
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:46,808
Well, it turns out
Restoration

358
00:14:46,832 --> 00:14:49,266
came back to the table.

359
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:51,035
When exactly did that happen?

360
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,636
<i>About an hour ago.</i>

361
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:55,830
Simon, I'm only
gonna ask you this once:

362
00:14:55,831 --> 00:14:58,198
Was this whole thing designed
to get Restoration

363
00:14:58,233 --> 00:14:59,566
back to the table?

364
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:01,435
It was designed to either
get them back

365
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,170
or to take a chance
on an up-and-comer.

366
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:05,572
Either way,
my malls don't sit empty.

367
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:08,475
Simon, you said
you were doing this deal.

368
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,977
You used me
to help sell him on it.

369
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:13,914
Then you shook his hand
and lied to his face.

370
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:16,027
I said what I needed to to
make a deal happen and I don't

371
00:15:16,051 --> 00:15:18,974
need to justify myself
to my own goddamn lawyer.

372
00:15:18,975 --> 00:15:21,810
<i>Now, this is happening,</i>
<i>and I need Restoration</i>

373
00:15:21,845 --> 00:15:23,778
to think that the Thomas deal
is still on.

374
00:15:23,814 --> 00:15:25,580
I know how negotiations work,
Simon.

375
00:15:25,615 --> 00:15:27,448
And I know how privilege
works,

376
00:15:27,484 --> 00:15:30,318
so if you tell anyone about
this, be it Thomas, or Alex,

377
00:15:30,353 --> 00:15:32,187
or the Queen of England,
we'll be done.

378
00:15:36,758 --> 00:15:39,325
All right, that should be
the last variable.

379
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
What's it say?

380
00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:43,729
Hold on, it's calculating--
goddamnit.

381
00:15:43,765 --> 00:15:45,932
It only narrowed the list
down to 800.

382
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:49,312
Well, that's a lot lower
than what we started with,

383
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,649
so maybe we can--
- What, get it down to 300?

384
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:54,818
What difference will it make?
We have less than a day.

385
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:55,719
Look, what do you
want me to say?

386
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,621
It was an idea, Katrina.

387
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,190
I didn't know the program
wouldn't work this time.

388
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:03,794
I know, Brian, I'm sorry.
I'm just...

389
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,328
Wait a second.

390
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,464
The program
didn't work this time,

391
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,467
but the program didn't work
last time either.

392
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:13,336
It said other people
were more valuable than you.

393
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,342
And while I love being
reminded of that

394
00:16:15,343 --> 00:16:16,787
I don't see how that--
- Think about it.

395
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:18,577
PATTIE was wrong
because she didn't take

396
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:20,512
into account your intangibles.

397
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:22,214
I had to be convinced
to keep you.

398
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:24,283
You mean we need to convince
that property owner

399
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:26,952
that our client
is more valuable

400
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,220
than whoever they want
to replace us with.

401
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:31,355
Exactly.

402
00:16:33,902 --> 00:16:35,001
Samantha, whatever it is--

403
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,728
I wanna talk about what
happened in court today.

404
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,572
Doesn't matter what happened
in court, because it's over.

405
00:16:39,608 --> 00:16:41,374
I'm here because
it doesn't have to be.

406
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,942
You--

407
00:16:42,978 --> 00:16:44,844
Are you--no,
I'm not breaking the law.

408
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,646
Louis,
he assaulted you.

409
00:16:46,681 --> 00:16:47,959
You cannot let him
get away with it.

410
00:16:47,983 --> 00:16:50,483
He did get away with it,
Samantha.

411
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:52,419
He walked away.

412
00:16:52,454 --> 00:16:54,220
And now
I'm gonna do the same thing.

413
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:56,456
Don't you get it?
You can't do that.

414
00:16:56,491 --> 00:16:57,769
- Not with him out there.
- Damnit, Samantha.

415
00:16:57,793 --> 00:17:01,394
You don't think I know
how dangerous he is?

416
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,216
He fucking knows where I live.
I'm not gonna risk it.

417
00:17:04,217 --> 00:17:06,117
Louis, he's a bully.

418
00:17:06,152 --> 00:17:07,796
And bullies only have power
if you let them.

419
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,088
No, bullies only have power
because they have guns

420
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:13,658
and knives and nothing to lose,
but I do,

421
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:15,701
and the only reason that
criminal out there knows that

422
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,780
I have a family is 'cause I let
you convince me to do this.

423
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,604
Well, I'm not gonna make
that mistake again.

424
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,305
What I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna let it go

425
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,307
and I don't want to hear
another word about it.

426
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,878
Harvey, what's the story?

427
00:17:28,913 --> 00:17:30,090
You guys sign that deal yet
because--

428
00:17:30,114 --> 00:17:32,481
We can talk about the deal
in a minute, Alex.

429
00:17:32,517 --> 00:17:34,784
I need to ask you something.
It's hypothetical, but--

430
00:17:34,895 --> 00:17:36,395
What's going on?

431
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,431
You got two clients,
both in a deal together.

432
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:41,566
One bills seven figures,
the other five.

433
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,736
They both wave conflict,
then you find out the big one

434
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,471
was planning to screw over
the little one.

435
00:17:46,507 --> 00:17:49,274
Son of a bitch.
This isn't hypothetical.

436
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:50,420
This Simon Lowe
and Thomas Kessler.

437
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,644
- Answer the question.
- You know the answer.

438
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:54,357
You stick with the bigger
fish, but it doesn't matter

439
00:17:54,381 --> 00:17:55,592
who's a bigger client
because you can't

440
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,597
break privilege anyway.
- I know.

441
00:17:57,598 --> 00:17:58,531
Then why the hell
are you telling me?

442
00:17:58,566 --> 00:18:00,533
I'm telling you
because I don't like it

443
00:18:00,568 --> 00:18:02,346
and we may not have to tell
Thomas but that doesn't mean

444
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,447
we can't do something about it.

445
00:18:03,471 --> 00:18:05,538
And since I'm not supposed
to know about this

446
00:18:05,573 --> 00:18:06,784
and you're not supposed to
undercut your client,

447
00:18:06,808 --> 00:18:08,274
what are we supposed to do?

448
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:09,809
Look,
Simon will stick with Thomas

449
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,544
if Restoration falls out
again.

450
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:12,819
So we're gonna make
that happen.

451
00:18:12,847 --> 00:18:14,446
Are you crazy?

452
00:18:14,482 --> 00:18:16,315
In what world does that
not get back to Simon?

453
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,317
The world where I can get
someone to do it for us.

454
00:18:18,352 --> 00:18:20,197
Well, if you're gonna do
that, what do you need me for?

455
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:21,587
The backup plan,
which is to get

456
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:24,223
Thomas's original landlord
to beat Simon's deal.

457
00:18:24,258 --> 00:18:25,958
They won't even take my call.

458
00:18:25,993 --> 00:18:28,111
Alex, one of us is gonna get
this thing done,

459
00:18:28,112 --> 00:18:31,313
but we don't have much time,
so are you in or you out?

460
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,497
I can get to you any time.

461
00:19:01,835 --> 00:19:03,235
No.
No!

462
00:19:21,487 --> 00:19:22,552
I'm in.

463
00:19:24,523 --> 00:19:26,323
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

464
00:19:26,358 --> 00:19:28,358
- Just tell me what I have to do.
- Nothing.

465
00:19:28,394 --> 00:19:29,993
Consider the matter handled.

466
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:32,362
- Wha--how are you gonna--
- Louis,

467
00:19:32,398 --> 00:19:34,898
just let me do what I do.
- No, I'm not gonna just

468
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:36,933
sit on the sidelines.
I wanna be a part of it.

469
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,635
I don't think
that's a good idea.

470
00:19:38,671 --> 00:19:40,137
Samantha, I'm not gonna
live in fear

471
00:19:40,172 --> 00:19:41,870
my whole life.
You said it yourself.

472
00:19:41,871 --> 00:19:44,405
The only way that's gonna
happen is if I stand up to him.

473
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,208
Then be prepared
to testify again.

474
00:19:47,243 --> 00:19:49,810
Because I have a feeling new
evidence is gonna come to light

475
00:19:49,846 --> 00:19:51,913
that links him
to that mugging.

476
00:19:51,948 --> 00:19:53,514
I'll be ready.

477
00:19:54,851 --> 00:19:57,351
Damnit, I don't care
if your firm has conflict.

478
00:19:57,387 --> 00:19:59,921
I need this.

479
00:19:59,956 --> 00:20:02,156
Yeah? Well, I'll remember
that the next time

480
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:03,824
you come to me for a favor.

481
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,961
Harvey, do you have a second?

482
00:20:08,996 --> 00:20:10,896
Of course, Donna.
What do you need?

483
00:20:10,932 --> 00:20:14,500
Well, it's just, Thomas
is so excited about this deal.

484
00:20:14,535 --> 00:20:16,669
I wanna take him out to
celebrate and I was wondering,

485
00:20:16,704 --> 00:20:18,315
do you think that it's gonna
close by tonight

486
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:19,605
or by tomorrow night?

487
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,473
It won't be tonight.

488
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:23,652
We still need to get approval
from Simon's board.

489
00:20:23,653 --> 00:20:24,864
But wouldn't the board
approve it

490
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:27,522
before approaching him?
- Well, they did in concept.

491
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:30,325
Now they just need
to approve the actual deal

492
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,859
which takes a beat.

493
00:20:31,895 --> 00:20:35,430
I get it.
This is about Elaine Phillips.

494
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:37,398
I heard she's in Norway,
and you don't know when

495
00:20:37,434 --> 00:20:38,744
she'll be back
and you don't want me

496
00:20:38,768 --> 00:20:40,535
to have to keep
this from Thomas.

497
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,370
That's right.
You got me.

498
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:46,434
No, Harvey.
There is no Elaine Phillips.

499
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,436
And when I asked you
about this deal closing

500
00:20:48,472 --> 00:20:50,383
you got a look on your face
and I want to know why.

501
00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:52,307
We are not having
this conversation.

502
00:20:52,342 --> 00:20:54,776
Yes, we are,
because I can't make sense

503
00:20:54,811 --> 00:20:56,344
of why you're acting like this

504
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,273
other than Thomas's deal
is in trouble.

505
00:20:58,274 --> 00:21:00,041
I'm not gonna tell you
what's going on.

506
00:21:00,076 --> 00:21:01,809
And I'm not leaving
until you do,

507
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,489
and if I do leave,
I'm just going to call him

508
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:06,580
and tell him
that something's going on so--

509
00:21:06,616 --> 00:21:08,382
Okay.

510
00:21:08,418 --> 00:21:10,151
You know what...

511
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,585
All right,
you wanna know?

512
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:15,934
Simon was using Thomas
as a stalking horse.

513
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:20,272
- I don't believe this.
- Donna, we can fix it.

514
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,612
Fix it?
There is no fixing it.

515
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:24,789
Thomas isn't going to want to
be in business with Simon

516
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,081
when he finds out about this
no matter what you do.

517
00:21:27,082 --> 00:21:28,359
And he's not going to
to find out about it

518
00:21:28,383 --> 00:21:31,351
because if we tell him
we betrayed our other client.

519
00:21:31,386 --> 00:21:33,634
- And what about this client?
- Tell you about this client.

520
00:21:33,635 --> 00:21:35,168
I went to Alex
to get us out of this.

521
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:38,071
He's gonna try and get Thomas's
original mall owner

522
00:21:38,106 --> 00:21:40,340
to sweeten the deal.
- What are you going to do?

523
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,208
I'm gonna try to get
Restoration to back out,

524
00:21:42,244 --> 00:21:44,244
and either of these things
can work

525
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:46,913
but only
if we don't tell Thomas.

526
00:21:46,949 --> 00:21:50,483
You are putting me
in a really shitty position.

527
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:53,253
No, Donna, Simon put us all
in a shitty position.

528
00:21:53,288 --> 00:21:57,390
I'm busting my ass
to get us out of this.

529
00:21:57,885 --> 00:21:59,418
I just need you to trust me.

530
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:05,668
You wanna tell me
what's going on

531
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:06,758
with you and Louis Litt?

532
00:22:06,794 --> 00:22:07,692
What are you talking about?

533
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:09,094
I'm talking about
the fact I heard

534
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:11,897
about what happened in court
yesterday, and I know you.

535
00:22:11,932 --> 00:22:13,143
You're not
about to let this lie.

536
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:14,633
So what if I'm not?

537
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:16,202
So I want you not to do

538
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:17,447
whatever it is I know
you're going to.

539
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:21,940
Look, if this is about
plausible deniability,

540
00:22:21,976 --> 00:22:23,976
don't worry about it.
Consider yourself out of it.

541
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:26,144
It has nothing to do
with plau--

542
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,613
Samantha,
you cannot do what we did.

543
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:30,515
I'm telling you,
you'll regret it.

544
00:22:30,551 --> 00:22:32,150
Bullshit.

545
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:35,454
- You didn't regret it.
- Yes, I did.

546
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:37,189
And since when is that?

547
00:22:37,224 --> 00:22:38,702
Because the last time
we talked about it

548
00:22:38,726 --> 00:22:40,425
you were right as rain.

549
00:22:40,461 --> 00:22:42,861
Last time we talked
about it was eight years ago.

550
00:22:42,896 --> 00:22:44,863
And you don't know
what happens over time

551
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:47,232
when you do something
like that.

552
00:22:49,406 --> 00:22:52,440
He's hurting, Robert.

553
00:22:52,476 --> 00:22:54,109
Louis is hurting.

554
00:22:54,144 --> 00:22:56,144
You saw what he was like
when it happened.

555
00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:59,814
You saw what I was like
when it happened to me.

556
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,217
So what am I supposed to do?

557
00:23:02,252 --> 00:23:05,386
I want you to promise me
to find another way.

558
00:23:15,085 --> 00:23:17,752
Donna,
I was just thinking about you.

559
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:19,265
I was just thinking about
you too, Mom.

560
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:20,655
Funny how that happens.

561
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,891
What's on your mind, honey?

562
00:23:22,926 --> 00:23:24,192
Do you remember
my senior year

563
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:25,794
when we were gonna go
to Paris?

564
00:23:25,829 --> 00:23:28,697
Of course I remember.
Why?

565
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:30,899
<i>Well,</i>
<i>I have a decision to make.</i>

566
00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:36,404
One side is work and the other
side is someone I care about.

567
00:23:36,997 --> 00:23:39,030
Actually, both sides involve
someone I care about.

568
00:23:39,066 --> 00:23:42,000
<i>I bet I can guess</i>
<i>who the work side involves.</i>

569
00:23:42,035 --> 00:23:44,335
But what does that
have to do with Paris?

570
00:23:44,566 --> 00:23:46,232
Do you regret giving Dad
the money?

571
00:23:46,268 --> 00:23:47,567
No, I don't.

572
00:23:47,602 --> 00:23:49,569
<i>Even though</i>
<i>it didn't work out?</i>

573
00:23:49,604 --> 00:23:52,338
<i>Well,</i>
<i>how could I have known that?</i>

574
00:23:52,374 --> 00:23:54,340
Because dad
let you down before.

575
00:23:54,376 --> 00:23:57,911
Donna, your father
has never let me down.

576
00:23:57,946 --> 00:24:00,046
Not in the ways that matter.

577
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:01,214
What do you mean?

578
00:24:01,249 --> 00:24:04,484
<i>Your father is the kindest,</i>

579
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:05,852
<i>gentlest,</i>

580
00:24:05,887 --> 00:24:07,887
most loving man
I have ever met,

581
00:24:07,923 --> 00:24:09,689
and if I hadn't shown
faith in him,

582
00:24:09,724 --> 00:24:11,090
it would have eaten away at him

583
00:24:11,126 --> 00:24:13,259
for the rest of his life.

584
00:24:13,825 --> 00:24:16,425
So...

585
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:19,995
if you had it all
to do over again,

586
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:21,797
would you make the same choice?

587
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:25,234
I can't tell you that,
but what I do regret

588
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:27,870
is we never took that trip.

589
00:24:27,905 --> 00:24:30,739
So go with your gut
but don't let

590
00:24:30,775 --> 00:24:33,175
the once in a lifetime
chances pass you by.

591
00:24:33,211 --> 00:24:34,810
Hey, Mom.

592
00:24:36,848 --> 00:24:38,948
What do you say
we go to Paris next year?

593
00:24:38,983 --> 00:24:41,484
I say yes.

594
00:24:43,354 --> 00:24:47,436
<i>Mr. Barrow, this isn't</i>
<i>about amounts of ammonia</i>

595
00:24:47,437 --> 00:24:49,905
<i>so small they're a technical</i>
<i>violation of our lease.</i>

596
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,207
This is about you having
another tenant

597
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:53,842
willing to pay more.

598
00:24:53,877 --> 00:24:56,278
Who I may or may not have
doesn't matter.

599
00:24:56,313 --> 00:24:58,847
It should, because we're
willing to offer you

600
00:24:58,882 --> 00:25:00,248
something they're not.

601
00:25:00,284 --> 00:25:02,184
10% equity in the company.

602
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:04,568
A fledgling company
with unproven revenue.

603
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,440
No, Morgan,
they're more than that.

604
00:25:06,441 --> 00:25:08,675
You see,
when you look at our client

605
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,678
you see a naive, young,
entrepreneur and not much else.

606
00:25:11,713 --> 00:25:14,380
And on paper
that's exactly what she is.

607
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:16,382
But sometimes
who someone is on paper

608
00:25:16,418 --> 00:25:17,317
isn't who they are at all.

609
00:25:17,352 --> 00:25:19,485
My client may be young,

610
00:25:19,521 --> 00:25:21,254
but she's brilliant,

611
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:22,889
and hard working,

612
00:25:22,924 --> 00:25:25,725
and most importantly,
passionate.

613
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,594
That's why I'm proud
to work with her

614
00:25:27,629 --> 00:25:30,763
and why if you get in
on the ground floor right now

615
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,801
you won't need to worry about
leases or any of that anymore,

616
00:25:34,836 --> 00:25:38,137
because you'll be on an island
somewhere sipping piña coladas

617
00:25:38,173 --> 00:25:42,041
paid for by the brilliant
decision you made today.

618
00:25:42,077 --> 00:25:45,144
The only thing I'd be paying
for is some snake oil

619
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,248
and a silver tongue
because that's the biggest load

620
00:25:48,283 --> 00:25:50,550
of sappy bullshit--
- Shut your mouth.

621
00:25:50,585 --> 00:25:52,819
This man is
defending his client's honor.

622
00:25:52,854 --> 00:25:54,487
He's doing it by offering you
something

623
00:25:54,522 --> 00:25:56,042
you don't even deserve
and I've had it.

624
00:25:56,382 --> 00:25:57,459
- Katrina.
- You think I don't know

625
00:25:57,483 --> 00:25:59,750
who your mysterious
other tenant is?

626
00:25:59,805 --> 00:26:01,104
I do.

627
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:03,540
And if a food distribution
company rents space

628
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:06,343
that's been exposed to
significant amounts of ammonia

629
00:26:06,378 --> 00:26:09,312
without you disclosing it,
you'll go to prison.

630
00:26:09,348 --> 00:26:10,881
You can't do this.

631
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:12,515
Yes, we can,
you piece of shit.

632
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:15,485
In fact,
that offer just went away.

633
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,153
So keep us in or kick us out

634
00:26:17,189 --> 00:26:18,788
but your next tenant
isn't going to be

635
00:26:18,824 --> 00:26:21,925
the goddamn one
you had in mind.

636
00:26:28,703 --> 00:26:30,170
I've never seen you
like that.

637
00:26:30,206 --> 00:26:32,573
Where did that come from?

638
00:26:32,608 --> 00:26:35,442
It came from knowing
this is your first client,

639
00:26:35,478 --> 00:26:37,912
and I wasn't going
to let them beat you.

640
00:26:37,947 --> 00:26:39,947
Just like you've done
for me countless times.

641
00:26:39,982 --> 00:26:42,483
But how did you even know
what company it was?

642
00:26:42,993 --> 00:26:44,192
I didn't.

643
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:46,428
But 50%
of PADDIE's predictions

644
00:26:46,463 --> 00:26:49,598
were food companies,
so I bluffed.

645
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:51,800
If it had turned out
they made clocks

646
00:26:51,835 --> 00:26:54,669
we would have been
in big trouble.

647
00:26:54,705 --> 00:26:56,471
What?

648
00:26:56,507 --> 00:26:59,341
You continue to surprise me.

649
00:26:59,376 --> 00:27:01,109
Because I never saw you
as someone

650
00:27:01,145 --> 00:27:03,311
who'd take a chance
on a 50/50 bet.

651
00:27:03,347 --> 00:27:05,347
I wouldn't have
before I met you.

652
00:27:05,382 --> 00:27:07,949
Well, then I guess
I've made you a better lawyer.

653
00:27:07,985 --> 00:27:09,951
I meant in my mind
it was 50/50

654
00:27:09,987 --> 00:27:11,164
if keeping you on
was going to work out.

655
00:27:11,188 --> 00:27:12,788
I don't believe it.

656
00:27:12,823 --> 00:27:14,932
You're gambling,
you're making jokes,

657
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,800
- Who are you?
- Well, I'll tell you who I am.

658
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,969
I am the person

659
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,404
who is proud
to officially give you

660
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,740
your first solo client.

661
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:27,510
Thanks, Katrina.
I really appreciate it.

662
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:29,980
I can't wait to go home
and share the news.

663
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,656
What's going on?
Did you take care of it?

664
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,524
Change of plans.

665
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,360
What do you mean
change of plans?

666
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,639
I didn't even know what the
plan was in the first place.

667
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,929
Yes, you did.

668
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,204
I was gonna do something
illegal

669
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:48,643
and now I'm not gonna
do that anymore.

670
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,367
What's the new plan.

671
00:27:53,379 --> 00:27:54,912
Are you talking
about leveraging--

672
00:27:54,947 --> 00:27:56,347
Yes, I am.

673
00:27:56,382 --> 00:27:58,315
- Samantha, this is a child.
- I know what it is.

674
00:27:58,351 --> 00:27:59,861
Then you of all people,
coming from where you

675
00:27:59,885 --> 00:28:02,171
come from, should know that
doing this could ruin her life.

676
00:28:02,172 --> 00:28:03,438
Only if it doesn't work.

677
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,040
Which is why
we'll make it work.

678
00:28:05,075 --> 00:28:06,975
- No, we're not.
- Then I'll do it alone.

679
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,309
I don't think you heard me.

680
00:28:08,345 --> 00:28:10,211
You said you don't
want to live in fear.

681
00:28:10,247 --> 00:28:12,547
No, I said
I wanna go after him.

682
00:28:12,582 --> 00:28:14,249
This is going after him.

683
00:28:14,284 --> 00:28:16,217
Goddamn it, it's his family!

684
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,721
It's a family.

685
00:28:22,207 --> 00:28:24,774
I know it is,
Louis.

686
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:27,877
But it's your family, too.

687
00:28:27,913 --> 00:28:30,313
So what do you wanna do?

688
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:34,961
Look, all I'm saying is,
would it be so terrible

689
00:28:34,996 --> 00:28:37,563
if Thomas Kessler became
the official furniture

690
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:39,399
of the United Nations?

691
00:28:39,434 --> 00:28:41,479
I'm sorry, am I going on too
much about this expansion?

692
00:28:41,503 --> 00:28:42,935
Because we can go out
right now,

693
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,437
don't have to talk
about it at all.

694
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,306
No, no, no, it's not that.
It's just--

695
00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:49,175
I haven't been feeling well.

696
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,477
Yeah, you know, I had that
same feeling earlier today.

697
00:28:51,513 --> 00:28:52,412
How so?

698
00:28:52,447 --> 00:28:54,648
My original mall owner
called me.

699
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,379
He wants me back.

700
00:28:56,415 --> 00:28:58,481
He even offered a much better
deal than Simon.

701
00:28:58,517 --> 00:29:00,116
Thomas, that's fantastic.

702
00:29:00,152 --> 00:29:01,885
Why would that make you
feel bad?

703
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,998
Because I already have a deal
in place with Simon Lowe.

704
00:29:04,022 --> 00:29:06,322
It was hard to tell him
you're backing out?

705
00:29:06,358 --> 00:29:10,093
No, it was hard to tell Glen
that I was passing.

706
00:29:10,128 --> 00:29:11,128
What?

707
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,998
- You passed on a better deal?
- Not formally,

708
00:29:15,033 --> 00:29:16,900
but when I told him
Glen gave me up

709
00:29:16,935 --> 00:29:19,836
until 10:00 tomorrow
to decide and...

710
00:29:19,871 --> 00:29:21,082
Look, I'll take it
as a courtesy

711
00:29:21,106 --> 00:29:23,173
but I really don't need to.

712
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:25,809
I shook Simon's hand.
He's my guy.

713
00:29:29,281 --> 00:29:31,681
- What?
- Nothing.

714
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:35,552
It's one of the things
that I admire about you.

715
00:29:35,587 --> 00:29:38,021
You're a man of your word.

716
00:29:38,056 --> 00:29:41,991
But speaking of not feeling
well, I think I'm just gonna

717
00:29:42,685 --> 00:29:43,951
go get some ginger ale.

718
00:29:43,986 --> 00:29:45,619
Oh, Donna, come on.
Don't be silly.

719
00:29:45,654 --> 00:29:47,265
- Let me get it for you.
- No, no, no, actually,

720
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:49,356
I think I need some fresh air.

721
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:51,169
You stay here, I'm gonna be
back in ten minutes.

722
00:29:51,193 --> 00:29:52,960
- Sure?
- I'm sure.

723
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,170
- Hello?
<i>- What's going on</i>

724
00:30:03,205 --> 00:30:04,645
with getting
Restoration to back out?

725
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:05,774
Thomas didn't tell you?

726
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:07,676
Alex got his original landlord

727
00:30:07,711 --> 00:30:08,810
to crush Simon's offer.

728
00:30:08,846 --> 00:30:10,979
He did tell me, Harvey,
and he also told me

729
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:13,849
that he's not taking it,
and it disappears tomorrow.

730
00:30:13,884 --> 00:30:15,717
Shit.

731
00:30:15,753 --> 00:30:17,452
Look, we can still fix it.

732
00:30:17,488 --> 00:30:18,832
How the hell
are we going to fix it?

733
00:30:18,856 --> 00:30:20,622
I can get Restoration
to back out.

734
00:30:20,658 --> 00:30:23,425
And what if you don't?
Because Thomas is going to lose

735
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,071
his expansion and I'm not
gonna let that happen.

736
00:30:25,095 --> 00:30:27,829
Neither am I, Donna.
This thing isn't over.

737
00:30:27,865 --> 00:30:29,598
I just need you to have faith.

738
00:30:29,633 --> 00:30:31,700
I'll text you in the morning
but please,

739
00:30:31,735 --> 00:30:33,535
don't do anything
until you hear from me.

740
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,471
Okay, Harvey.

741
00:30:36,507 --> 00:30:38,440
I'll wait to hear from you.

742
00:30:47,544 --> 00:30:48,576
What are you doing here?

743
00:30:48,612 --> 00:30:50,645
We're here because we know
the mother of your child

744
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,480
is the recipient of Section 8
housing benefits

745
00:30:52,516 --> 00:30:54,249
and she's in danger
of losing them.

746
00:30:54,284 --> 00:30:55,528
- What are you talking about?
- That kind of assistance

747
00:30:55,552 --> 00:30:57,819
can't go to someone
with a criminal history.

748
00:30:57,854 --> 00:30:59,387
She doesn't have
a criminal history.

749
00:30:59,422 --> 00:31:01,289
- But you do.
- I don't live there.

750
00:31:01,324 --> 00:31:03,436
Oh, really, 'cause you said
you did when you got arrested.

751
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,395
Also have a gas bill
with your name on it.

752
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,563
If we go to the housing
authority with this

753
00:31:07,598 --> 00:31:09,365
you'll lose your daughter.
- Bullshit.

754
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,092
No, not bullshit, Maurice.
You're getting evicted.

755
00:31:12,093 --> 00:31:13,792
You think Family Services
is gonna

756
00:31:13,828 --> 00:31:15,160
let your little girl
be homeless?

757
00:31:15,196 --> 00:31:17,596
What do you want from me?
Your money back?

758
00:31:17,632 --> 00:31:18,642
'Cause that ain't happening.

759
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:20,177
What I want is for you
to turn yourself in

760
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:21,367
and admit what you did.

761
00:31:21,402 --> 00:31:23,035
You think that's
what's happening here?

762
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,536
I know that's what's
happening here.

763
00:31:24,572 --> 00:31:26,538
Nah, you ain't doing that.

764
00:31:26,574 --> 00:31:27,751
Why do you think I picked you?

765
00:31:27,775 --> 00:31:30,376
I could'a taken ten people
into that alley,

766
00:31:30,411 --> 00:31:33,345
but the second I saw you
I knew you were my guy.

767
00:31:33,381 --> 00:31:34,826
You stupid motherfucker.
When you held that gun

768
00:31:34,827 --> 00:31:35,801
to my head,
you told me not

769
00:31:35,802 --> 00:31:36,912
to look at you
and I was afraid.

770
00:31:36,913 --> 00:31:38,546
Do I seem afraid now?

771
00:31:38,581 --> 00:31:40,559
'Cause only one person's
making a phone call tonight.

772
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:41,816
You're turning yourself in

773
00:31:41,851 --> 00:31:43,095
or I'm calling
the Housing Authority.

774
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:45,219
No way you put a woman
and child on the street.

775
00:31:45,255 --> 00:31:47,121
I'm not putting her there,
Mo.

776
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:48,323
You are.

777
00:31:48,358 --> 00:31:50,024
Watch.

778
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,660
Nah, you ain't doing that.
I know where you live.

779
00:31:52,696 --> 00:31:53,940
<i>You've reached the</i>
<i>New York Housing Authority.</i>

780
00:31:53,964 --> 00:31:56,197
Hi, Housing Authority,
I'd like to report

781
00:31:56,232 --> 00:31:57,677
a Section 8 violation.
- Put the phone down.

782
00:31:57,701 --> 00:31:59,968
Well, there's a woman who's
living with a criminal

783
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:02,048
and she intentionally is
leaving his name off the lease.

784
00:32:02,072 --> 00:32:04,772
- I said put it down.
- You can call Family Services

785
00:32:04,808 --> 00:32:06,085
because the woman's name--
- You mother--

786
00:32:09,296 --> 00:32:10,432
What's it gonna be?

787
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:12,800
'Cause in another two seconds
they'll have your name.

788
00:32:12,836 --> 00:32:14,645
Okay, I'll make the call.

789
00:32:14,646 --> 00:32:16,579
Well, no,
I just made it for you.

790
00:32:16,614 --> 00:32:18,614
- 911. Say hi.
<i>- 911, what's your emergency?</i>

791
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:21,617
- I want to report a crime.
<i>- Sir, what did you witness?</i>

792
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:23,753
I ain't a witness.
I'm the one who did it.

793
00:32:30,862 --> 00:32:32,295
Am I interrupting?

794
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,796
No, I was just reading.

795
00:32:33,831 --> 00:32:35,498
Tennessee Williams.

796
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:37,600
I know it might cost a little
more,

797
00:32:37,635 --> 00:32:40,336
but if anyone is doing one of
his plays when we're in Paris--

798
00:32:40,371 --> 00:32:44,140
Actually, honey, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

799
00:32:44,175 --> 00:32:45,708
- Paris.
- What about it?

800
00:32:45,743 --> 00:32:48,644
Your dad has a building
he wants to buy,

801
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,013
and in order to secure
the loan we're gonna ha--

802
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:53,015
He needs our Paris money.

803
00:32:53,051 --> 00:32:54,951
Honey, it doesn't mean
we're not gonna go,

804
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:57,706
it just means we can't go
this year.

805
00:32:57,707 --> 00:32:59,440
But you saved for so long,

806
00:32:59,476 --> 00:33:00,975
and if you use
the money for this--

807
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,744
It--it's not like that.

808
00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:05,713
In two years we're gonna have
our money back, plus more,

809
00:33:05,749 --> 00:33:07,749
and then we're gonna be able
to go for a month,

810
00:33:07,784 --> 00:33:09,484
instead of two weeks.

811
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,853
You're not sure
this is gonna work, are you?

812
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:16,524
I forgot you can do that.

813
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,594
Donna, I promise you,

814
00:33:19,629 --> 00:33:22,563
we are going to Paris.

815
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:24,365
I understand.

816
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
Another year.

817
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:30,549
You know, I gotta say,
I may be coming around

818
00:33:30,584 --> 00:33:32,351
to your way
of making coffee after all.

819
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:36,855
Thomas, Simon Lowe was using
you as a stalking horse.

820
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:38,857
The deal you made was
a ploy to get

821
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:41,326
Restoration Hardware
to the table.

822
00:33:41,362 --> 00:33:42,628
You're their backup plan.

823
00:33:42,663 --> 00:33:44,329
That's why your deal
hasn't closed yet.

824
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:49,168
And why are you the one telling
me this and not my lawyer?

825
00:33:49,203 --> 00:33:52,171
'Cause Alex
is trying to fix it,

826
00:33:52,206 --> 00:33:55,333
and so is Harvey but I don't
know that they're going to be

827
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:58,244
able to fix it and you said
that your other offer expires

828
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:00,212
this morning and I don't wanna
be responsible.

829
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,614
Donna, you are not
responsible for anything, okay?

830
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,851
So what are you going to do?

831
00:34:05,886 --> 00:34:07,486
I'll tell you what
I'm not gonna do.

832
00:34:07,521 --> 00:34:09,521
Let the company that I spent
my life nurturing

833
00:34:09,556 --> 00:34:10,956
get taken out at the knees

834
00:34:10,991 --> 00:34:13,658
just when
it's starting to walk.

835
00:34:17,498 --> 00:34:20,233
Thomas, I didn't see we had
a meeting on the books.

836
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:22,436
We didn't, but don't
worry, this won't take long.

837
00:34:22,471 --> 00:34:23,637
I'm going with Glen.

838
00:34:23,672 --> 00:34:26,707
Thomas,

839
00:34:26,742 --> 00:34:28,775
that's great.
I'll get on it right away.

840
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:30,698
Well, listen,
first things first,

841
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:32,635
I wanna issue a press release
this morning.

842
00:34:32,636 --> 00:34:35,116
I don't want the world to think
that we're going with Pierpont.

843
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,117
- Listen--
- Unless there's some reason

844
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:38,218
why you wouldn't want me
to announce the fact

845
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,008
that I'm pulling
out of the deal.

846
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:41,521
- You know?
- You're damn right I know.

847
00:34:41,545 --> 00:34:42,611
Donna told me.

848
00:34:42,646 --> 00:34:43,690
And she wouldn't have had to

849
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,914
if you hadn't
kept this from me.

850
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,761
I kept it from you because
I shouldn't have even known.

851
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:49,697
And you got that deal from Glen
because I made it happen.

852
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:51,854
What you did was leverage him
into a better deal

853
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,733
based on Pierpont's offer
which is something

854
00:34:53,734 --> 00:34:55,534
I never would have
even wanted.

855
00:34:55,569 --> 00:34:57,781
Which is why I'm taking Glen's
offer at the original rate

856
00:34:57,805 --> 00:34:59,571
and I'm putting out
an announcement about it.

857
00:34:59,607 --> 00:35:01,373
Thomas, you do that,
it screws over the guy

858
00:35:01,409 --> 00:35:02,653
who told us about this
in the first place.

859
00:35:02,677 --> 00:35:04,143
I'm sorry, Alex.

860
00:35:04,178 --> 00:35:06,211
This is my business
and my reputation.

861
00:35:06,247 --> 00:35:08,125
I'm putting out a message out
there that I'm not going to

862
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:11,250
act in bad faith
or be treated in bad faith.

863
00:35:11,285 --> 00:35:13,118
So either you put out
that press release

864
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:15,254
or I'm gonna do it myself.

865
00:35:22,629 --> 00:35:25,697
Brian, how are you
this bright morning?

866
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:27,265
I'm okay, Katrina,

867
00:35:27,301 --> 00:35:29,968
but there's something
I have to tell you.

868
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,436
By all means,
go right ahead.

869
00:35:31,471 --> 00:35:34,539
Last night I was having
dinner with Julie

870
00:35:34,574 --> 00:35:37,642
and I started telling her
about us and the case

871
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:39,210
and what we did for Bespoke.

872
00:35:39,246 --> 00:35:41,680
Where are you going
with this?

873
00:35:41,715 --> 00:35:43,114
The whole time I was talking

874
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,816
I wasn't talking about the case

875
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,619
or the client,
I was talking about you.

876
00:35:47,654 --> 00:35:49,254
And Julie said
you sound so great,

877
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:50,889
we should have you over
for dinner,

878
00:35:50,924 --> 00:35:53,955
and then she saw
a look on my face.

879
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:55,994
Brian.

880
00:35:57,051 --> 00:36:00,486
She asked if anything
had ever happened between us.

881
00:36:00,521 --> 00:36:02,355
- And I said no.
- And nothing ever will.

882
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,657
But even if it doesn't,
I can't feel this way

883
00:36:04,692 --> 00:36:06,459
about someone who isn't Julie.

884
00:36:06,494 --> 00:36:08,661
Brian,
what are you saying?

885
00:36:08,696 --> 00:36:11,063
I can't work here anymore.

886
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:12,031
What?

887
00:36:13,835 --> 00:36:16,168
- No, you can't--
- I have to.

888
00:36:16,204 --> 00:36:18,237
Then I'll go to Louis
right now

889
00:36:18,272 --> 00:36:20,439
and you can be someone
else's associate.

890
00:36:20,475 --> 00:36:21,907
Stop.

891
00:36:23,277 --> 00:36:25,111
Brian, please don't do this.

892
00:36:25,146 --> 00:36:26,512
It's gonna be okay.

893
00:36:28,316 --> 00:36:30,349
I promise.

894
00:36:30,385 --> 00:36:32,451
No, it's not.

895
00:36:39,653 --> 00:36:41,587
But I respect your decision.

896
00:36:45,326 --> 00:36:46,658
Good-bye, Katrina.

897
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:55,661
Harvey, where the hell
have you been?

898
00:36:55,685 --> 00:36:56,995
I've been texting you
for two hours.

899
00:36:57,019 --> 00:36:58,525
Alex, I know we're running
out of time,

900
00:36:58,526 --> 00:37:00,622
but I think I've got a way
to get Restoration

901
00:37:00,623 --> 00:37:01,933
to drop out.
- It's too late for that.

902
00:37:01,957 --> 00:37:03,885
Your problem's going to be
keeping Restoration in.

903
00:37:03,886 --> 00:37:05,419
What are you talking about?

904
00:37:05,454 --> 00:37:07,921
Donna told Thomas everything.

905
00:37:07,957 --> 00:37:09,289
That's--no.

906
00:37:09,325 --> 00:37:11,358
- How could she do that?
- I don't know,

907
00:37:11,394 --> 00:37:13,271
but what I do know is he
dropped out and he's taking out

908
00:37:13,295 --> 00:37:14,740
a full paid ad
in the journal to say it.

909
00:37:14,764 --> 00:37:16,463
Fuck. All right.

910
00:37:16,499 --> 00:37:18,232
Right now, I gotta call Simon

911
00:37:18,267 --> 00:37:20,234
and tell him to close
that Restoration deal

912
00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:23,003
as soon as possible.
- It's too late for that.

913
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:26,872
They called and demanded a 30%
reduction or they're gone.

914
00:37:26,907 --> 00:37:29,541
Look, I know it's a setback,
but Thomas isn't the only

915
00:37:29,577 --> 00:37:31,377
stalking horse out there.
I can find you--

916
00:37:31,412 --> 00:37:33,746
You're not gonna find me
anything until you can tell me

917
00:37:33,781 --> 00:37:34,847
you're not behind this.

918
00:37:34,882 --> 00:37:36,548
Simon,
I didn't tell Thomas a thing.

919
00:37:36,584 --> 00:37:39,184
And you're telling me
he didn't either, when the two

920
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,630
of you are just standing here
talking about my deal?

921
00:37:40,654 --> 00:37:42,521
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

922
00:37:42,556 --> 00:37:44,590
All I know if my client dropped
out and I was doing

923
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:46,191
your attorney a solid
by informing him.

924
00:37:46,227 --> 00:37:47,993
Bullshit.

925
00:37:48,029 --> 00:37:49,728
Someone let Thomas know,

926
00:37:49,764 --> 00:37:52,264
and since you're the only
person with the full story,

927
00:37:52,299 --> 00:37:53,932
it had to be you.

928
00:37:53,968 --> 00:37:56,068
And yet here you are,
lying right to my face.

929
00:37:56,103 --> 00:37:58,170
- Simon.
- Save it, Harvey.

930
00:37:58,205 --> 00:37:59,705
You're fired.

931
00:38:07,556 --> 00:38:10,524
What the hell did you do?

932
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:12,159
I did what I said
I was gonna do.

933
00:38:12,194 --> 00:38:13,794
You said you were gonna find
another way.

934
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:15,029
I did find another way.

935
00:38:15,064 --> 00:38:16,163
Bullshit.

936
00:38:16,198 --> 00:38:18,532
A man up and confesses
to a crime?

937
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:19,666
You blackmailed him.

938
00:38:19,702 --> 00:38:21,468
No, I used something he did

939
00:38:21,504 --> 00:38:24,171
to get him to confess
to something else he did.

940
00:38:24,206 --> 00:38:26,240
- That is not blackmail.
- It's messing with shit

941
00:38:26,275 --> 00:38:27,241
you don't have business
messing with.

942
00:38:27,276 --> 00:38:29,309
It has unintended consequences.

943
00:38:29,345 --> 00:38:31,078
Robert, I've had about enough
of your

944
00:38:31,113 --> 00:38:33,280
unintended consequences
bullshit.

945
00:38:33,315 --> 00:38:35,249
So either tell me
what you are talking about

946
00:38:35,284 --> 00:38:37,484
or shut the fuck up

947
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,620
Because Louis didn't get
the wrong guy

948
00:38:39,655 --> 00:38:42,738
and neither did you and I.
And don't you tell me we did.

949
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:45,539
Don't you see,
it's not about the wrong man.

950
00:38:45,575 --> 00:38:47,608
It's about taking matters
into your own hands

951
00:38:47,643 --> 00:38:49,410
and what happens
when you do that.

952
00:38:53,483 --> 00:38:55,850
You know, Robert,
I just don't get it.

953
00:38:55,885 --> 00:38:57,084
Louis is safe now.

954
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,320
How can you
not see that as a good thing?

955
00:38:59,355 --> 00:39:01,522
I know it's a good thing
for Louis, Samantha.

956
00:39:01,557 --> 00:39:04,125
What I'm afraid of is,
it's gonna become

957
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,761
a bad thing for you.

958
00:39:16,411 --> 00:39:17,755
Louis, can I talk to you
for a second?

959
00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:20,647
Of course, Brian, but if this
is about Bespoke Handbags,

960
00:39:20,682 --> 00:39:23,583
I already approved you
as our lead council.

961
00:39:23,618 --> 00:39:26,352
Actually,
that is why I'm here.

962
00:39:26,388 --> 00:39:27,854
I can't be
their lead council.

963
00:39:27,889 --> 00:39:29,589
Yes, you can, Brian.

964
00:39:29,624 --> 00:39:31,771
Because you deserve them,

965
00:39:31,772 --> 00:39:33,483
which is why I want you
to take them with you.

966
00:39:33,507 --> 00:39:36,408
But before I let you go,
I wanna know if this is about

967
00:39:36,443 --> 00:39:38,243
what's been going on between
you and Katrina.

968
00:39:38,278 --> 00:39:41,279
- What--how could you--
- I suspected a few weeks ago

969
00:39:41,315 --> 00:39:43,448
and then she told me.
- Then all I can say is

970
00:39:43,484 --> 00:39:46,318
it's about doing what I have
to, to protect my family.

971
00:39:46,847 --> 00:39:49,181
And I say I want you to take
Bespoke with you

972
00:39:49,216 --> 00:39:51,717
because you've earned them.
- I don't know what to say.

973
00:39:51,752 --> 00:39:53,852
You don't have to say
anything.

974
00:39:53,887 --> 00:39:56,588
Because as big
as this city is, Brian?

975
00:39:56,623 --> 00:39:59,324
It is a very small world.

976
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,570
We're gonna see you
in court some day,

977
00:40:00,594 --> 00:40:04,096
and when we do--
- I won't go easy on you.

978
00:40:04,131 --> 00:40:06,431
- Good man.
- Are you sure about all this?

979
00:40:06,467 --> 00:40:08,233
Come on, Brian.

980
00:40:08,268 --> 00:40:10,135
You're doing this
for your family.

981
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:13,138
Trust me,
no one understands

982
00:40:13,173 --> 00:40:15,440
sacrificing for their family
more than me.

983
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,803
I'm proud of you.

984
00:40:23,309 --> 00:40:25,142
Whatever it is,
I don't want to hear it,

985
00:40:25,177 --> 00:40:26,610
so you can turn around.
- Harvey.

986
00:40:26,645 --> 00:40:28,578
Donna, Simon fired me.

987
00:40:28,614 --> 00:40:32,316
as he had every right to do
because I trusted you

988
00:40:32,351 --> 00:40:34,593
to keep your mouth shut
and you didn't.

989
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,521
- Because I couldn't.
- What the hell does that mean?

990
00:40:36,545 --> 00:40:38,545
It means I wasn't gonna
let someone I care about

991
00:40:38,581 --> 00:40:41,148
get screwed when I had
the power to stop it.

992
00:40:41,183 --> 00:40:42,549
In other words,

993
00:40:42,585 --> 00:40:44,775
you chose him over the firm.
- Yeah, I did.

994
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:48,177
I'm not gonna feel bad about it
because I always put

995
00:40:48,213 --> 00:40:50,046
the firm first whether it is
Mike's secret,

996
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:52,081
or Coastal Motors,
or a thousand other things.

997
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,549
Then don't feel bad about it,
Donna,

998
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:54,684
but get out of my office.

999
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:58,621
Okay, I see what this is.

1000
00:40:58,657 --> 00:41:00,097
I see what
you're really upset about.

1001
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,725
I'm upset
because I lost a client.

1002
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:04,572
No, you are upset because
I chose Thomas over you.

1003
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:06,329
- Is that what you think?
- Yeah, it is.

1004
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:09,062
Then you don't know anything,
because the only reason

1005
00:41:09,063 --> 00:41:11,797
I was breaking my back to save
his deal is because I know

1006
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:13,065
how much he means to you.

1007
00:41:13,101 --> 00:41:15,301
If it was anyone else,
I never would have told you

1008
00:41:15,336 --> 00:41:16,380
or Alex in the first place.

1009
00:41:16,404 --> 00:41:18,170
Then what are you
so mad about?

1010
00:41:18,206 --> 00:41:19,071
Because you didn't give me
a chance

1011
00:41:19,107 --> 00:41:21,440
to fix it
when you said you would.

1012
00:41:21,476 --> 00:41:24,677
You lost faith in me.

1013
00:41:25,054 --> 00:41:26,821
For all the time
that we have been together,

1014
00:41:26,856 --> 00:41:28,022
that has never happened.

1015
00:41:28,057 --> 00:41:30,591
Harvey, if there's anyone
in the world

1016
00:41:30,627 --> 00:41:33,828
I have faith in

1017
00:41:33,863 --> 00:41:35,596
it's you.

1018
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:38,506
But the clock was striking
midnight and I had to make

1019
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:40,808
a choice
and it is just a client.

1020
00:41:40,843 --> 00:41:43,911
Can't you understand that?

1021
00:41:44,441 --> 00:41:47,376
Am I interrupting?

1022
00:41:47,411 --> 00:41:49,578
What are you doing here,
Daniel?

1023
00:41:49,613 --> 00:41:51,480
I'm here because Simon Lowe
just hired me

1024
00:41:51,515 --> 00:41:52,592
as outside council
for Pierpont Malls.

1025
00:41:52,616 --> 00:41:54,283
All the lawyers in the world

1026
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:55,784
and he just happened
to call you?

1027
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,719
No, Donna, I called him,

1028
00:41:57,755 --> 00:41:59,054
and when I offered my services

1029
00:41:59,089 --> 00:42:00,333
free of charge,
he gladly accepted.

1030
00:42:00,357 --> 00:42:02,057
And what services
would those be?

1031
00:42:02,092 --> 00:42:04,560
Embezzling?
Extortion?

1032
00:42:04,595 --> 00:42:07,162
Suing this firm on behalf
of my new client.

1033
00:42:07,198 --> 00:42:09,031
You're a glutton
for punishment, Daniel.

1034
00:42:09,066 --> 00:42:11,333
- You know that, right?
- Talk tough all you want,

1035
00:42:11,368 --> 00:42:13,836
but you broke privilege

1036
00:42:13,871 --> 00:42:17,506
and now I'm gonna make you pay.
