1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,356
<i>Previously, on "Suits..."</i>

2
00:00:01,357 --> 00:00:02,433
I thought it might be nice
to get out there

3
00:00:02,434 --> 00:00:04,402
and get to know each other.
- I think what you really mean

4
00:00:04,426 --> 00:00:06,923
is you'd like to impress
the new managing partner.

5
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,451
- And what if I did?
- You wanna impress me?

6
00:00:08,451 --> 00:00:11,612
Do it with a big, fat client.
- Zane promised Samantha

7
00:00:11,613 --> 00:00:14,077
she'd be the next Name Partner.
- And did you tell him

8
00:00:14,078 --> 00:00:15,644
that you made the same promise
to Alex?

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,379
- No, I didn't.
- You wanna take me on,

10
00:00:17,414 --> 00:00:18,959
you go for it,
'cause I didn't get where I am

11
00:00:18,983 --> 00:00:20,782
by letting people like you
push me around.

12
00:00:20,818 --> 00:00:22,796
David Fox wants a fight
and I'm gonna give him one.

13
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,020
- A fight about what?
- He doesn't want to pay

14
00:00:25,055 --> 00:00:26,788
our cleaning woman overtime.
- Harvey,

15
00:00:26,824 --> 00:00:28,535
this isn't what we do.
- Mike would have done it.

16
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:29,769
And Mike's not here anymore
because he finally

17
00:00:29,793 --> 00:00:32,327
came to terms with the fact
that this isn't what we do.

18
00:00:32,363 --> 00:00:33,406
I'm not gonna let us
start losing clients

19
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,674
because you decided
the cleaning staff

20
00:00:34,698 --> 00:00:36,899
is more important
than the needs of this firm.

21
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:39,368
I didn't do anything
that you didn't sign off on.

22
00:00:39,403 --> 00:00:40,647
That's enough.
You don't go to war

23
00:00:40,671 --> 00:00:41,715
with the guy
that owns your house

24
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:42,804
over something like this.

25
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,473
End it, and end it today.

26
00:00:44,508 --> 00:00:46,842
I wanna make
a perfect baby with you.

27
00:00:46,877 --> 00:00:48,710
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

28
00:00:48,746 --> 00:00:50,646
And I don't want
to just pull the goalie.

29
00:00:50,681 --> 00:00:51,681
I want to start trying,

30
00:00:51,715 --> 00:00:53,582
and I want
to start trying right now.

31
00:00:53,617 --> 00:00:55,495
From everything you told me,
you promised Samantha

32
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:56,985
her name would go up next?
- I did.

33
00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:58,921
- I made Alex the same promise.
- Then I guess

34
00:00:58,956 --> 00:01:00,822
there's only one thing to do.

35
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:02,758
Kick the can down the road.
<i>- I know you think</i>

36
00:01:02,793 --> 00:01:04,726
we're in competition
for the same thing,

37
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:05,994
but we're not.

38
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,763
Robert Zane made me a promise.

39
00:01:07,798 --> 00:01:10,465
The next name that goes up
on the wall is mine.

40
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:15,871
Bunny rabbit goes
around the tree once...

41
00:01:15,906 --> 00:01:18,407
bunny rabbit goes
around the tree twice...

42
00:01:18,442 --> 00:01:21,843
And I say bunny rabbit,
bunny rabbit, wanna play nice?

43
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:24,913
- Sheila, what are you doing?
- I'm hunting "wabbits."

44
00:01:24,949 --> 00:01:26,126
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

45
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,683
Not Fudd.

46
00:01:27,718 --> 00:01:28,728
You know I can't resist
Elmer Fudd.

47
00:01:28,752 --> 00:01:31,453
- Why would you want to?
- Oh, my God, Shelia,

48
00:01:31,488 --> 00:01:34,022
I cannot right now.
- Why not?

49
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:36,091
Because I have
a client meeting,

50
00:01:36,126 --> 00:01:38,060
and it's not just me.
Zane's coming too.

51
00:01:38,095 --> 00:01:40,896
So whatever you had in mind,
it's going to have to wait.

52
00:01:40,931 --> 00:01:42,698
All right.

53
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:46,034
I didn't want
to have to do this, but...

54
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,070
I'm fertile...

55
00:01:48,105 --> 00:01:50,806
and I am ripe for the picking.

56
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,977
So I don't care whether
you have a meeting or not.

57
00:01:55,012 --> 00:01:58,714
I'm going to need
your Johnny Appleseed.

58
00:01:58,749 --> 00:02:00,060
Sheila, you know
if there's one thing

59
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:01,750
that revs me up more
than Elmer Fudd

60
00:02:01,785 --> 00:02:02,751
it's American folk heroes.
- Then I think it's time

61
00:02:02,786 --> 00:02:04,619
for Paul Bunyan to march
across that forest

62
00:02:04,655 --> 00:02:05,765
and take out his axe.
- Oh, I'm gonna

63
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:07,923
do more than that.

64
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,058
- You wouldn't.
- I would, because it's time

65
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:11,734
for John Henry
to swing the mighty hammer.

66
00:02:17,201 --> 00:02:19,801
Did you know?

67
00:02:19,837 --> 00:02:22,104
- Know what?
- That Zane promised Samantha

68
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:23,572
she was the next Name Partner.

69
00:02:23,607 --> 00:02:24,951
Alex, let's go back up
to my office.

70
00:02:24,975 --> 00:02:26,608
Sounds like
you could use a drink.

71
00:02:26,643 --> 00:02:28,154
What I could use
is some God damn honesty.

72
00:02:28,178 --> 00:02:30,445
Did you know?

73
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:32,147
- Yeah, I knew.
- Then why the hell

74
00:02:32,182 --> 00:02:33,915
didn't you tell me?
- Because no one's

75
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:35,929
deciding anything right now
and I didn't want to upset you

76
00:02:35,953 --> 00:02:37,819
for no reason.
- No reason?

77
00:02:37,855 --> 00:02:39,499
Zane promised his right hand--
- I know what he promised.

78
00:02:39,523 --> 00:02:41,656
But look, you got me
and you got Louis.

79
00:02:41,692 --> 00:02:43,458
That's two against one.

80
00:02:43,494 --> 00:02:45,105
When the time is right,
we'll out-vote him.

81
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:46,773
And when exactly
is the time going to be right?

82
00:02:46,797 --> 00:02:48,697
Six months? A year?
Three years?

83
00:02:48,732 --> 00:02:50,499
- Alex--
- No, Harvey, I want to know

84
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:51,578
when you're planning
on getting the balls

85
00:02:51,602 --> 00:02:53,602
to stand up to that man
and what exactly

86
00:02:53,637 --> 00:02:54,948
I'm supposed to do
in the meantime.

87
00:02:54,972 --> 00:02:56,383
I'll tell you
what you're supposed to do.

88
00:02:56,407 --> 00:02:57,784
You're supposed to have faith
and sit tight.

89
00:02:57,808 --> 00:02:58,707
And if you were
in my position,

90
00:02:58,742 --> 00:03:01,109
would you sit tight?

91
00:03:01,145 --> 00:03:03,512
It may not be easy
but, yeah, I would.

92
00:03:03,547 --> 00:03:05,125
That's funny,
because I recall you were in

93
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:07,682
a similar position years ago
with Jessica, and instead

94
00:03:07,718 --> 00:03:09,217
of sitting tight,
you came to me

95
00:03:09,253 --> 00:03:11,486
looking for another job.

96
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:23,999
- Robert, how's Wayne?
<i>- I'll tell you how he is.</i>

97
00:03:24,034 --> 00:03:25,634
He's getting sued,
and he wants to know

98
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:27,147
why his lawyer's not here.
<i>- All right,</i>

99
00:03:27,171 --> 00:03:28,681
just hold down the fort
for ten more minutes,

100
00:03:28,705 --> 00:03:30,505
I'm almost there.
<i>- I didn't ask you</i>

101
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,419
when you'd get here, Louis
I asked you where you were.

102
00:03:32,443 --> 00:03:34,721
- That's, uh, kind of personal.
<i>- Well, I feel kind of bad</i>

103
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:36,156
about that, Louis,
but I've been standing here

104
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,813
with nothing but my dick
in my hand

105
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:39,648
for the last 30 minutes.
<i>- All right, well,</i>

106
00:03:39,683 --> 00:03:41,194
if you wanna know, Sheila and I
are trying to have a baby

107
00:03:41,218 --> 00:03:42,717
and she's not getting
any younger,

108
00:03:42,753 --> 00:03:44,486
and we're just trying
to take advantage

109
00:03:44,521 --> 00:03:45,899
of any opportunity we can.
<i>- Why didn't you say so?</i>

110
00:03:45,923 --> 00:03:47,656
Just get here
as fast as you can.

111
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:49,891
Like I said,
I'll see you in ten.

112
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:51,493
- Hey, buddy.
- Yeah?

113
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:53,106
You know where a Rite Aid is
around here?

114
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,541
No, I'm sorry, I'm actually
not from around here--

115
00:03:54,565 --> 00:03:55,997
I don't give a shit
where you live.

116
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:57,899
Do what I say
and you won't get shot.

117
00:03:57,935 --> 00:03:59,568
You feel me?
- Yeah, I feel you,

118
00:03:59,603 --> 00:04:02,037
I feel you, I feel you.
- Good, let's walk.

119
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:10,846
Get on the ground, and don't
you fucking look at me.

120
00:04:10,881 --> 00:04:13,081
- Okay, okay.
- Wallet and phone.

121
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:17,152
Where's the phone?
- There's $1,000 in there,

122
00:04:17,187 --> 00:04:18,720
is that--is that not enough?

123
00:04:18,755 --> 00:04:19,833
You think
we're negotiating, here?

124
00:04:19,857 --> 00:04:21,857
No, no, no, it's just that
there--there's pictures

125
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:23,103
on my phone
that I haven't backed up.

126
00:04:23,127 --> 00:04:25,627
I don't give a shit!

127
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:30,098
Here's my phone.

128
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,936
Stay down.

129
00:04:34,972 --> 00:04:36,638

Louis, aren't you supposed

143
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:32,211
I swear,
if you cancelled that dinner

144
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:34,424
because they ran out
of paprika like last time I--

145
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:37,316
Oh, my God.
What happened, Louis?

146
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:38,383
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

147
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:40,318
You look like you've been hit

148

149
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:45,824
I didn't know what to do,
so I--I came here.

150
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:48,226
All right, I'm calling Sheila
and then Robert and--

151
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:50,662
You're not calling anyone,
Gretchen.

152
00:05:50,697 --> 00:05:52,297
I don't want Robert to know.

153
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:53,576
You have to tell him
what happened.

154
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,900
I can't.

155
00:05:55,936 --> 00:05:57,635
- Why not?
- Because he's

156
00:05:57,671 --> 00:05:59,382
my new managing partner
and I do not want him

157
00:05:59,406 --> 00:06:02,474
to know that I am weak.
- Louis, you are not weak.

158
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:04,309
It could have happened
to anybody.

159
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:05,555
it could have happened to him.
- Yeah, but it didn't.

160
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:07,345
It happened to me,
and that's why

161
00:06:07,381 --> 00:06:08,925
I don't want to tell him.
- Well, what are you gonna do?

162
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:10,426
'Cause he's gonna wanna know
why you didn't show up

163
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,594
to that meeting.
- I'm going to let him--

164
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:13,218
think what he already thinks.

165
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:14,119
That Sheila and I were trying
to have a child,

166
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:14,986
it took longer
than we thought--

167
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:15,787
- Louis.
- Gretchen, I'm done

168
00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:17,589
talking about this.

169
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:19,324
Can you just please let me be?

170
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:21,526
Okay, Louis,
I won't tell anybody.

171
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:24,596
I'm not going anywhere
until we patch you up.

172
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:37,342
If you're not careful,
the bagel guy's

173
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:38,588
going to figure out
you're cheating on him.

174
00:06:38,612 --> 00:06:40,223
- Who says this isn't a bagel?
- Same person who says

175
00:06:40,247 --> 00:06:42,747
you've got the sense of humor
of a five-year-old.

176
00:06:42,783 --> 00:06:45,350
I am so going to pull
your pigtails at recess.

177
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:47,263
Okay, do you want
to keep going, or can I ask you

178
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:48,520
a serious question?

179
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:49,621
- You want the truth?
- No.

180
00:06:49,656 --> 00:06:52,957
I want to talk to you
about doing more pro bonos.

181
00:06:52,993 --> 00:06:54,692
- Donna.
- Harvey, listen to me.

182
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:56,861
That cleaning woman's case
was good for you,

183
00:06:56,897 --> 00:06:58,363
and even though
Mike's not here,

184
00:06:58,398 --> 00:06:59,609
I think we should
keep doing them.

185
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:02,367
Donna, I might be missing
Mike, but I'm not Mike,

186
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:04,302
and I have a meeting
in an hour.

187
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:06,349
But if you want to take on
a pro Bono, knock yourself out.

188
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:08,151
You know what, I do,
and if you don't want it,

189
00:07:08,175 --> 00:07:09,908
I'm just going to go ask Alex.
- Not Alex.

190
00:07:09,943 --> 00:07:11,743
He's not in the mood.
- Why not?

191
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:13,711
He found out about Zane
promising Samantha

192
00:07:13,747 --> 00:07:15,914
Name Partner last night.
- What did you say to him?

193
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:17,894
What do you think I said?
I told him to sit tight.

194
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:19,762
Did you sit tight when you
were in the same position?

195
00:07:19,786 --> 00:07:21,820
- That's what he said.
- Then if you don't want him

196
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,455
doing what you did,
which is go looking

197
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,257
for another job,
then I suggest you do something

198
00:07:26,293 --> 00:07:28,560
that makes him want to stay.

199
00:07:28,595 --> 00:07:29,894
Now, I'm going to go
ask Katrina

200
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,796
if she wants to do a pro Bono.

201
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:37,435
I don't care what it takes.

202
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,781
You get him in front
of that judge,

203
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:40,338
I'll get him off the hook.

204
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:42,006
Good.

205
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:43,686
Whatever you're cooking,
I need you to bump

206
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,410
this class action
to the front of the line.

207
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:47,178
- Class action?
- Yeah, why?

208
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:48,854
You got a problem with that?
- No problem,

209
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:50,915
but litigation
isn't my specialty

210
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:52,684
and you know it,
so what's going on?

211
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:54,185
What's going on is,
this was

212
00:07:54,221 --> 00:07:55,687
Louis Litt's case
and now it's yours.

213
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:57,422
And how does Louis Litt
feel about that?

214
00:07:57,457 --> 00:07:58,868
I don't give a shit
about how he feels.

215
00:07:58,892 --> 00:08:00,458
Well, I do.

216
00:08:00,494 --> 00:08:01,637
I just got on good footing
around here,

217
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:03,761
I'm not looking to undo it.
Now I got to get to--

218
00:08:03,797 --> 00:08:05,897
Hold on, now.
You are my go-to.

219
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:07,665
Don't start playing
office politics on me.

220
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:10,201
Robert, I played
office politics for you

221
00:08:10,237 --> 00:08:12,770
for years, in case you forgot.
- I didn't, but the man pulled

222
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:15,340
a no-show to a meeting
with his own client

223
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,943
and I need to send a message,
so are you in or out?

224
00:08:20,514 --> 00:08:24,048
Okay, Robert.
I'm in.

225
00:08:29,256 --> 00:08:31,322
I'm sure whatever it is
is very important, Harvey,

226
00:08:31,358 --> 00:08:32,790
but I'm a little busy
right now.

227
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:34,125
Alex, you were right.

228
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,461
If I were in your shoes,
sitting tight wouldn't fly

229
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:37,829
with me either.

230
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:39,531
I thought about it,
and I got an idea.

231
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:41,332
Well, if it isn't you
and Louis telling Zane

232
00:08:41,368 --> 00:08:43,412
my number's up next, I'm not
sure I'm going to like it.

233
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:45,403
What it is
is you doing something

234
00:08:45,438 --> 00:08:48,506
to put you on the map
with Zane.

235
00:08:52,512 --> 00:08:55,480
- Paxson BioScience.
- They're big, they're juicy,

236
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:57,482
and we got a meeting with them
in a half an hour.

237
00:08:57,517 --> 00:08:58,816
- We?
- Yeah, we.

238
00:08:58,852 --> 00:09:00,485
Then forget it,
because if I don't

239
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,654
sign them alone,
Robert's not going to care.

240
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:04,522
Alex, I'm doing the best
I can right now.

241
00:09:04,558 --> 00:09:06,257
They're expecting me.
I don't show up,

242
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:08,004
it's not going to look right.
- You've got an answer

243
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:09,839
for everything, don't you?
- Let's just go down there

244
00:09:09,863 --> 00:09:11,729
and lock these guys down.

245
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:15,066
After that, you have my word.
You're the attorney of record.

246
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:18,937
All right, Harvey.
Let's go lock them down.

247
00:09:24,544 --> 00:09:26,578
Carrie, Harvey Specter.

248
00:09:26,613 --> 00:09:29,213
This is my partner,
Alex Williams.

249
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:31,382
I'm sorry, I was thinking
it was just going to be

250
00:09:31,418 --> 00:09:32,850
the two of us.
- It's okay.

251
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:34,419
Anything you can say
in front of me,

252
00:09:34,454 --> 00:09:35,753
you can say to Alex.

253
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:37,755
In that case...

254
00:09:39,426 --> 00:09:40,892
CrytoGen.

255
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:42,638
They're worth 80 million,
but they're sitting

256
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:44,462
on billions of undeveloped IP.

257
00:09:44,497 --> 00:09:45,975
I've been trying to buy them
for two years.

258
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:47,599
Let me guess, you've used

259
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:48,644
every tactic in the book
to force them to sell.

260
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:49,367
Now you're looking
to try some

261
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:51,302
that aren't
in the book.

262
00:09:51,338 --> 00:09:53,037
Let's just say
that of the 15 companies

263
00:09:53,073 --> 00:09:55,607
that specialize
in financing that industry,

264
00:09:55,642 --> 00:09:57,809
14 have suddenly
found themselves out

265
00:09:57,844 --> 00:09:59,377
of the CrytoGen business.

266
00:09:59,412 --> 00:10:01,479
And isn't it
the strangest coincidence

267
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:04,115
that the 15th just so happens
to be one of our clients?

268
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,050
The Lord works
in mysterious ways.

269
00:10:06,086 --> 00:10:07,585
Just to be clear,
are you asking us

270
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:08,631
to pressure one of our clients

271
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:10,655
into cutting off
this company's lifeline?

272
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,623
Because that would be
against the law.

273
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:13,725
I'm not asking you
to do anything.

274
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,792
But were that to happen,

275
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:17,495
you'd suddenly find yourself
with a huge new client.

276
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,975
I'd say that sounds
pretty interesting.

277
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:20,476
And I say bullshit.
It's not going happen.

278
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,466
Well it better,
because that's what it's

279
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:23,568
going to take
to get our business.

280
00:10:23,603 --> 00:10:25,114
Alex, why don't we listen to
what she has to say--

281
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:26,849
No, Harvey, I'm not looking
to cross the line

282
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:28,484
for these guys, and I
don't care if they tell me

283
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:29,919
they'll guarantee a year's
retainer in advance.

284
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:31,576
And what if I told you

285
00:10:31,611 --> 00:10:34,445
that retainer would match
your highest-billing client?

286
00:10:34,481 --> 00:10:37,015
Look, I think it's a mistake,
but if we're going do this,

287
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,861
we need to know
what we're getting involved in.

288
00:10:38,885 --> 00:10:41,052
He's right.
You want us to risk this,

289
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:43,588
we need to knew every source
of funding you choked off

290
00:10:43,623 --> 00:10:45,523
from these guys,
and every other shady thing

291
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:46,669
you've done,
because like he said,

292
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:47,859
I need to know exactly

293
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:51,796
what I'm getting myself
involved in.

294
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:53,142
Then we'll have everything
over to you

295
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,466
by the end of the day.

296
00:11:00,774 --> 00:11:03,041
- Robert, got a sec?
- No, Louis, I don't.

297
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:04,787
Look, I know I said
that I'd be a little late--

298
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:06,678
But instead you decided
to tap your girlfriend

299
00:11:06,713 --> 00:11:08,212
instead of doing
your God damn job.

300
00:11:08,248 --> 00:11:10,126
Robert, I told you,
we're trying to have children.

301
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,450
You also told me you were
on your way to the meeting,

302
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:14,118
and I don't appreciate
being lied to.

303
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:16,788
Okay, listen to me.

304
00:11:16,823 --> 00:11:18,856
I know I didn't show up,
but it doesn't matter

305
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:20,736
because whatever their issue is
I can handle it.

306
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,238
You don't have to handle it
because I already did.

307
00:11:22,262 --> 00:11:23,594
What is that
supposed to mean?

308
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,907
It means that
as of this morning,

309
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:26,898
Samantha Wheeler
is handling the matter,

310
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:28,678
so you have plenty of time
for your family planning.

311
00:11:28,702 --> 00:11:30,535
I am Name Partner.
This is one of

312
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,148
my oldest clients.
You cannot do this to me.

313
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:33,805
I didn't do this to you.

314
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,873
You did it to yourself
when you hung me out to dry.

315
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:38,810
Robert, please.

316
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:40,178
You don't know
the whole story.

317
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:42,080
I know all I need to know.

318
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:45,817
Now get out of my office
and don't ever lie to me again.

319
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:53,951
Gretchen I need you to the
file room right away and make

320
00:11:53,952 --> 00:11:56,291
every document we have on
McKinley Outfitters disappear.

321
00:11:56,517 --> 00:11:58,727
Can't do that, Louis.
I got instructions to send them

322
00:11:58,728 --> 00:12:00,996
over to Samantha Wheeler's
office an hour ago.

323
00:12:00,997 --> 00:12:02,295
What?
How could you do that to me?

324
00:12:02,296 --> 00:12:03,440
Because Robert Zane
stood here

325
00:12:03,464 --> 00:12:05,097
and gave me
an order himself.

326
00:12:05,132 --> 00:12:06,765
What choice did I have?
- God damn it.

327
00:12:06,801 --> 00:12:08,667
Louis, I didn't tell the man
what happened

328
00:12:08,702 --> 00:12:11,170
because I promised I wouldn't,
but he's punishing you

329
00:12:11,205 --> 00:12:13,150
for something you don't deserve
to be punished for,

330
00:12:13,174 --> 00:12:15,874
so why don't you just tell him?
- I'm not going to look weak.

331
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,687
Well, having him take
your client because you don't

332
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:19,156
have the courage
to tell him the truth

333
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,979
doesn't exactly
make you look strong.

334
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:22,848
Well, then I need
to take my client back.

335
00:12:22,883 --> 00:12:24,327
How the hell
are you going to do that?

336
00:12:24,351 --> 00:12:25,784
Easy.
She's a transactional woman.

337
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,785
I'll just tell her
I owe her one.

338
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:29,555
And you ask her
to go against Zane?

339
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,790
You might as well ask her
to set herself on fire.

340
00:12:31,826 --> 00:12:32,791
Well, maybe if you'd
God damn help me

341
00:12:32,827 --> 00:12:33,725
instead of telling me
how weak I am,

342
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:35,727
maybe we could
figure something out.

343
00:12:35,763 --> 00:12:38,163
Louis, I am trying
to help you.

344
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:41,900
And if you can't see that,
then something's wrong.

345
00:12:41,936 --> 00:12:45,370
Gretchen, please.
You're the only one who knows

346
00:12:45,406 --> 00:12:48,540
that I had
my dignity taken last night.

347
00:12:48,576 --> 00:12:50,142
I can't have it taken again.

348
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,713
All right, Louis.

349
00:12:54,748 --> 00:12:56,915
I help you with this,
I need to know

350
00:12:56,951 --> 00:12:58,094
that you're going to be able
to keep it together.

351
00:12:58,118 --> 00:13:00,819
All I need
is to take my client back.

352
00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:01,855
That's all I need.
- Okay.

353
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:04,590
As I see it,
you want McKinley back?

354
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,391
You need to put that woman
in a position

355
00:13:06,427 --> 00:13:09,228
where she doesn't
have any choice.

356
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:14,199
Sounds to me
like the good folks

357
00:13:14,235 --> 00:13:15,979
at Paxson BioScience have been
some busy little beavers.

358
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,013
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

359
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:19,004
I sure am.
If they're willing to do

360
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,350
all this shady shit
because CrytoGen

361
00:13:20,374 --> 00:13:21,707
has billions
in future revenue--

362
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:22,886
Why don't we skip
the shady shit

363
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,843
and go represent
CrytoGen right now?

364
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,278
Exactly.
And we got the road map

365
00:13:26,313 --> 00:13:27,858
to keeping them out of trouble
on its way.

366
00:13:27,882 --> 00:13:30,082
Alex, you are
one devious mother----er.

367
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:31,750
Thanks, I'll take that
as a compliment.

368
00:13:31,785 --> 00:13:33,296
In that case, you're a
real asshole of a guy, too.

369
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:36,154
Seriously, Harvey.

370
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,122
We're using information
they gave us

371
00:13:37,157 --> 00:13:38,168
in the context of a meeting.

372
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,859
That's a little shady itself.

373
00:13:40,895 --> 00:13:43,028
You sure you're okay with it?
- I am.

374
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:44,107
Besides,
what are they gonna do?

375
00:13:44,131 --> 00:13:46,965
Tell the police they asked us
to rob a bank

376
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:49,201
and by the time they got there,
we moved all the money?

377
00:13:49,236 --> 00:13:51,370
Then the only thing left
to do is close CrytoGen.

378
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:54,106
- All right, I'll set it up.
- No.

379
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:55,318
You needed to be
at that last meeting.

380
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:56,808
You don't need
to be at this one.

381
00:13:56,844 --> 00:13:57,954
- Alex--
- Harvey, let's not forget

382
00:13:57,978 --> 00:13:59,878
why you came to me with this.

383
00:13:59,914 --> 00:14:01,780
Let me bring this one home.

384
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:05,317
All right.
They're all yours.

385
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:15,327
- You wanted to see me?
- I did.

386
00:14:15,362 --> 00:14:17,462
Well, I'm glad you did,
because I heard

387
00:14:17,498 --> 00:14:20,899
that you gave one
of Louis's clients to Samantha

388
00:14:20,935 --> 00:14:23,146
and I don't want to tell you
how to run the firm, Robert,

389
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,404
but I think that's a bad idea.

390
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:28,173
Well, that's not exactly
what I wanted to talk about,

391
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,242
but I think
it's a good platform.

392
00:14:30,277 --> 00:14:32,344
- I don't follow.
- You may not want to tell me

393
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:33,823
how to do my job,
but I'm going to tell you

394
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:34,646
how to do yours.
- Excuse me?

395
00:14:34,682 --> 00:14:37,015
Did you assign
Katrina Bennett

396
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:38,817
a pro Bono
without running it by me?

397
00:14:38,852 --> 00:14:40,063
I didn't know that I needed
to run it by you.

398
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,387
You do when that client
happens to conflict

399
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,523
with someone
I'm trying to sign.

400
00:14:44,558 --> 00:14:45,702
- I didn't know they did.
- Which is why

401
00:14:45,726 --> 00:14:46,925
you run it by me.

402
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:49,261
And was is more important
is what is a COO

403
00:14:49,296 --> 00:14:51,196
of a law firm doing
handing out pro bonos

404
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:52,464
in the first place?

405
00:14:52,499 --> 00:14:53,865
I just thought
that it was good--

406
00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:55,334
It's a rhetorical question,
Donna.

407
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:57,836
I don't care what you thought.
- Understood.

408
00:14:57,871 --> 00:14:59,371
Is that all?
- No, it's not.

409
00:14:59,406 --> 00:15:01,306
What a COO should be doing

410
00:15:01,342 --> 00:15:05,143
is maximizing our revenue
per square foot,

411
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:08,347
which starts by an assessment
of our revenue per square foot.

412
00:15:08,382 --> 00:15:09,881
Well, that's not really
what I do.

413
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:11,850
It is now.
I want a report on my desk

414
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:14,152
by end of day tomorrow.

415
00:15:15,522 --> 00:15:17,155
Does this have anything
to do with Louis?

416
00:15:17,191 --> 00:15:18,724
Because I don't think--
- It has to do

417
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:20,537
with Louis lying to me,
and Harvey getting into it

418
00:15:20,561 --> 00:15:23,161
with the landlord, and now you,
which all adds up

419
00:15:23,197 --> 00:15:25,041
to this law firm not operating
the way that it should

420
00:15:25,065 --> 00:15:28,233
and me getting
a little tired of it.

421
00:15:28,268 --> 00:15:31,203
Now, that's all.

422
00:15:45,886 --> 00:15:47,552
Ah, Samantha.
You look nice this evening.

423
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:49,399
Oh, don't give me that shit.
You want to tell me

424
00:15:49,423 --> 00:15:51,534
why you set a motion to dismiss
on a case for tomorrow

425
00:15:51,558 --> 00:15:52,924
that I just got
three hours ago?

426
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,359
I was just doing you a favor.

427
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:57,329
But if you want to cancel it,
you go right ahead.

428
00:15:57,364 --> 00:15:59,164
It's your case.
- What do you mean a favor?

429
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,244
I mean, we have two weeks
to get this suit thrown out

430
00:16:01,268 --> 00:16:02,434
but the faster we file it,

431
00:16:02,469 --> 00:16:04,336
the more serious
they know we are.

432
00:16:04,371 --> 00:16:06,416
And of course now that you've
said it, if I delay it,

433
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,273
I look like I'm unprepared.
- Which you are,

434
00:16:08,308 --> 00:16:09,452
because you haven't
been their attorney

435
00:16:09,476 --> 00:16:10,520
for the last 13 years
like I have.

436
00:16:10,544 --> 00:16:12,110
I get it.

437
00:16:12,146 --> 00:16:13,323
And if I tell Robert
what you did, I look weak.

438
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:18,216
But if you let me help you,
we both look strong.

439
00:16:18,252 --> 00:16:19,184
Why didn't you
just come to me,

440
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:21,086
and ask me to be
let in on this?

441
00:16:21,121 --> 00:16:23,121
Because we both know
that you would have said no.

442
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:27,392
I have to admit,
if I didn't know any better

443
00:16:27,428 --> 00:16:28,571
I'd say you're a real badass.

444
00:16:28,595 --> 00:16:29,673
Well, if you think
I'm a badass now,

445
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,662
you just wait until we get
that lead plaintiff

446
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,598
in front of the judge tomorrow.

447
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,205
- Hey.
- Don't "hey" me.

448
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,275
Did you sign them?
- Sure did, but get this.

449
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,888
These guys aren't exactly
Little Red Riding Hood

450
00:16:44,912 --> 00:16:46,578
running away
from the Big Bad Wolf.

451
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:48,291
- What are you talking about?
- Our first assignment,

452
00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:50,248
after we send
that cease and desist to Paxson

453
00:16:50,284 --> 00:16:53,251
is to trick their best employee
into a lifetime of servitude.

454
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:55,287
Don't tell me you're pulling
a Mike Ross and having

455
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:57,422
second thoughts on me.
- I'm just saying,

456
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,591
there aren't any saints
in this situation.

457
00:16:59,626 --> 00:17:01,159
But you know what, brother?

458
00:17:01,195 --> 00:17:03,061
That's why we make
the big bucks.

459
00:17:03,097 --> 00:17:05,230
Well then,
pour us a couple of drinks,

460
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:07,399
and I'll fax the cease
and desist order right away.

461
00:17:07,434 --> 00:17:08,967
You're not faxing shit.

462
00:17:09,002 --> 00:17:10,402
Do you really think
that you can

463
00:17:10,437 --> 00:17:12,337
take a meeting with a
prospective client,

464
00:17:12,372 --> 00:17:14,250
try to screw them over, and
they wouldn't catch wind of it?

465
00:17:14,274 --> 00:17:15,285
I don't care if they
caught wind of it.

466
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:16,586
There's nothing that they
can do about it.

467
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,244
Bullshit, they can let
every major player know

468
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:21,191
that we don't deal
with our clients in good faith.

469
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:22,836
But they have the decency
to give us a chance

470
00:17:22,837 --> 00:17:24,253
to make it right
before they do,

471
00:17:24,254 --> 00:17:25,150
and you're going to take it.

472
00:17:25,185 --> 00:17:26,839
If you're saying
what I think you're saying--

473
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,420
I'm saying
drop the small potato,

474
00:17:28,455 --> 00:17:31,089
and sign Paxson like you said
you would in the first place.

475
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,425
You want to talk bad faith?
We went in there

476
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,427
and they all but asked us
to commit a crime.

477
00:17:35,462 --> 00:17:37,863
Then don't sign them.
But what you don't do

478
00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:39,865
is go using the information
that you got from them

479
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,444
to sign a guy that they
were going after.

480
00:17:41,468 --> 00:17:42,645
And the last time I checked,
I can sign

481
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:44,469
whoever the hell
I want to sign.

482
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:47,105
Harvey, I cut you some slack
on that landlord thing.

483
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:49,174
But I'm running this firm,
not you.

484
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:50,687
You're going to do
what I tell you to do.

485
00:17:50,711 --> 00:17:52,021
You going to tell me
what suit to wear, too?

486
00:17:52,045 --> 00:17:53,245
Listen to me.

487
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,283
Tomorrow morning, I come in,
Paxson's our client.

488
00:17:58,318 --> 00:18:00,285
And I'm done discussing
this topic.

489
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,692
Harvey,
maybe it isn't worth it.

490
00:18:07,728 --> 00:18:10,462
Relax, he'll calm down
once he realizes

491
00:18:10,497 --> 00:18:12,531
that small potato
is not so small.

492
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:14,900
Are you crazy?
This is about chain of command.

493
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:16,246
And the only reason
we signed those guys

494
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,580
in the first place
was to impress him.

495
00:18:17,604 --> 00:18:19,137
And you were the one
who wanted me

496
00:18:19,173 --> 00:18:21,006
to have the balls
to stand up to him.

497
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,986
Well, I don't give a shit
what the chain of command is.

498
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,910
There's no way
I'm backing down now.

499
00:18:24,945 --> 00:18:27,345
Harvey, I told you, it's
not like these guys are saints.

500
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:28,491
What they're having me
do to this guy--

501
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:29,815
Alex, that's enough.

502
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,150
I'm not interested
in you second guessing me,

503
00:18:32,186 --> 00:18:33,496
and I'm sure as shit
not interested

504
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,487
in you doing it
on Zane's behalf.

505
00:18:35,522 --> 00:18:37,189
So you want to have a drink

506
00:18:37,224 --> 00:18:39,591
and celebrate
signing a new client or not?

507
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,384
Robert,
what are you doing here?

508
00:18:55,419 --> 00:18:57,386
I'm here because
it's tomorrow morning,

509
00:18:57,421 --> 00:18:59,988
and you didn't sign Paxson yet.

510
00:19:00,024 --> 00:19:01,890
Look, Robert,

511
00:19:01,925 --> 00:19:03,336
as far as I'm concerned,
this is between you and Harvey.

512
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,326
Well, I'm making it
between you and me.

513
00:19:04,361 --> 00:19:05,794
What are you saying?

514
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:06,973
I'm saying you're
a smart guy,

515
00:19:06,997 --> 00:19:10,165
and we both know what
your endgame is at this firm.

516
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,344
If you want that game
to be a reality,

517
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:13,235
you do what I need you to do.

518
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,415
- Are you threatening my job?
- I'm telling you how it is.

519
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:17,406
You dealt with that client
in bad faith,

520
00:19:17,441 --> 00:19:19,753
and I'm doing you a courtesy by
dealing with you in good faith.

521
00:19:19,777 --> 00:19:21,421
- It sure doesn't feel like it.
- I didn't say I was giving you

522
00:19:21,445 --> 00:19:24,246
kid gloves, I said I was
playing you straight.

523
00:19:24,281 --> 00:19:27,249
The truth is I like you,
always have.

524
00:19:27,284 --> 00:19:30,085
But if you don't get yourself
on the right of this thing,

525
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,421
you're never going to go
further than you are right now.

526
00:19:32,456 --> 00:19:35,190
- Robert--
- Drop them.

527
00:19:35,225 --> 00:19:37,759
I don't want to hear another
goddamn thing about it.

528
00:19:47,404 --> 00:19:49,337
Okay, what's our plan?

529
00:19:49,373 --> 00:19:52,941
Okay, listen up.
They don't know it,

530
00:19:52,976 --> 00:19:54,287
but we're going to file
for a change of venue

531
00:19:54,311 --> 00:19:56,011
in addition
to our motion to dismiss.

532
00:19:56,046 --> 00:19:57,824
I don't understand.
Changing the venue to Omaha

533
00:19:57,848 --> 00:19:59,459
doesn't help us.
The laws are harsher there.

534
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:01,349
Doesn't matter,
because the jury won't be.

535
00:20:01,385 --> 00:20:02,284
What do you mean?

536
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:03,585
This lawsuit
wasn't just filed

537
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,955
by a random bunch
of disgruntled backpackers.

538
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,024
It was orchestrated.
- By who?

539
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:10,959
Our biggest competitor.

540
00:20:10,994 --> 00:20:14,129
And it just so happens Omaha
used to be their headquarters.

541
00:20:14,164 --> 00:20:16,531
Which is now a ghost town.
We go after them in Omaha,

542
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:18,467
they're going to get
their asses kicked.

543
00:20:18,502 --> 00:20:20,346
And they'll have no grounds
to fight the change of venue,

544
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,571
because on the face of it,
it's against our interests.

545
00:20:22,606 --> 00:20:24,539
- Exactly.
- Louis, this is genius.

546
00:20:24,575 --> 00:20:26,174
Yeah, I know.
But like I said,

547
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,076
you think I'm a genius now,
you just wait.

548
00:20:28,112 --> 00:20:30,090
Because by the end of today,
they're going to be paying us.

549
00:20:30,114 --> 00:20:32,314
All rise.

550
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:35,150
Oh, shit, I have an emergency
with my oldest client.

551
00:20:35,185 --> 00:20:36,196
You sure you got this?
- Oh, I got this.

552
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,919
I just feel bad for you because

553
00:20:37,955 --> 00:20:39,032
you're not going to
get to see it.

554
00:20:39,056 --> 00:20:41,123
Hm.

555
00:20:43,227 --> 00:20:44,926
All right.

556
00:20:44,962 --> 00:20:46,528
We're here for a motion
to dismiss.

557
00:20:46,563 --> 00:20:48,330
Mr. Litt,
do you have your paperwork?

558
00:20:48,365 --> 00:20:50,499
Your Honor, I'm sorry,
but due to recent information

559
00:20:50,534 --> 00:20:53,502
coming to light,
we need to alter our motion

560
00:20:53,537 --> 00:20:55,770
to change of venue.
- What?

561
00:20:55,806 --> 00:20:57,772
They have--they have
no basis for that.

562
00:20:57,808 --> 00:21:00,442
We believe we do, Your Honor.
Which is why we'd like to call

563
00:21:00,477 --> 00:21:02,344
their lead plaintiff
to the stand.

564
00:21:07,818 --> 00:21:11,353
- Mind if I cut in?
- That depends, is it urgent?

565
00:21:11,388 --> 00:21:13,255
To tell you the truth, it is.

566
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,023
Zane already thinks
I overstep my bounds.

567
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:16,136
The last thing I need
is for him to think

568
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,393
that I can't hand in
my homework on time, too.

569
00:21:18,428 --> 00:21:20,228
Well, if that's
what he thinks about you,

570
00:21:20,264 --> 00:21:21,563
you can have the copier,

571
00:21:21,598 --> 00:21:24,232
and Robert Zane
can go fuck himself.

572
00:21:24,268 --> 00:21:27,402
Hey.
Everything okay?

573
00:21:27,437 --> 00:21:28,970
- Never been better.
- Alex.

574
00:21:29,006 --> 00:21:30,372
I'm really
not in the mood, Donna.

575
00:21:30,407 --> 00:21:33,008
Yeah, I can see that,
and I don't care.

576
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:36,111
What's going on?
- All right, you want to know?

577
00:21:36,146 --> 00:21:38,046
First thing this morning,
Zane tells me

578
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:40,949
unless I sign Paxson, my name's
never going up on that wall.

579
00:21:40,984 --> 00:21:41,883
What?
Have you told Harvey

580
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,052
about this?
- What good would it do?

581
00:21:44,087 --> 00:21:45,498
Harvey's the one who put me in
this goddamn situation.

582
00:21:45,522 --> 00:21:46,666
Wait, hang on a second,
I thought you were

583
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,390
on board
with going after CrytoGen.

584
00:21:48,425 --> 00:21:50,225
I don't give a shit
what I was on board with.

585
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,005
When Zane didn't want to do it,
I was ready to back off.

586
00:21:52,029 --> 00:21:53,828
- Then back off.
- And I do that,

587
00:21:53,864 --> 00:21:55,975
I might as well kiss my chances
at Name Partner good-bye,

588
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:57,883
Alex, I don't think you're
giving Harvey enough credit.

589
00:21:57,884 --> 00:21:59,083
He said, and I quote:

590
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,918
"I'm sure as shit
not interested

591
00:22:00,954 --> 00:22:03,955
in you second guessing me
on Robert Zane's behalf."

592
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,057
- Good.
- What do you mean, good?

593
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:08,025
I mean you're in a
<i>Kobayashi Maru.</i>

594
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:09,705
What the hell does sushi
have to do with this?

595
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:11,696
It's not sushi,
it's from "Star Trek,"

596
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:14,966
and Harvey's been talking
about it for a hundred years.

597
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,168
I always thought it was
bullshit, but maybe it's not.

598
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:19,203
- What do you mean?
- I mean, sooner or later,

599
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:22,573
everyone finds themselves
walled into a no-win situation.

600
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:25,143
This one's yours,
and the way to prove yourself

601
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:28,246
to both Harvey and Zane
is to find a way out anyway.

602
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:29,714
Well, thanks, Donna.

603
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:30,760
And here I thought
going to Harvard

604
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:32,817
was the way to get ahead,
when really,

605
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:35,086
I should have just been
watching old "Star Trek"s.

606
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:36,654
Well, I didn't,
so unless the answer

607
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,167
is in an episode
of "Cagney and Lacey"--

608
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,769
You know what, Alex?
I'm trying to help you.

609
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:41,859
And I told you,
I'm not in the goddamn mood.

610
00:22:41,895 --> 00:22:43,528
Okay, then let me
put it another way.

611
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:44,673
Unless you think you can
get your name on the wall

612
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,931
someplace else,
I suggest you stop worrying

613
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:49,011
about the problem, and start
worrying about the solution.

614
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,568
Because if you can't find a way

615
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:52,203
to get yourself
out of this situation,

616
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:54,672
maybe you don't deserve to be
Name Partner after all.

617
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:02,013
So, Mr. Larson, when did you
decide to file this lawsuit?

618
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,681
About a week
after I found out

619
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,583
hackers stole my information.

620
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:08,452
So you were upset, and then,
you contacted a lawyer.

621
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:10,032
Actually, my attorney
reached out to me.

622
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,689
Oh, wasn't that convenient?

623
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,591
Your Honor, soliciting
clients isn't a crime,

624
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:15,104
and it's not relevant
to change of venue.

625
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:16,861
But isn't it?
Mr. Larson, when your lawyer

626
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,941
approached you, what was the
fee that you were quoted?

627
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:20,865
Ten percent,
contingent on winning.

628
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,600
And are you aware
that the normal fee

629
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:24,869
for this type of case is
three times that?

630
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,771
I'm not one
to say no to a bargain.

631
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:28,584
You mean the bargain where
my client's biggest competitor

632
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:29,919
was paying your lawyers
on the side?

633
00:23:29,943 --> 00:23:31,576
- What?
- Objection, speculative.

634
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:32,888
It won't be
when he answers the question.

635
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,579
Your Honor,
where is this going?

636
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,058
I'll tell you
where it's going, Your Honor.

637
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:37,882
It's going to
conspiracy charges

638
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,117
because he approached him

639
00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:41,330
to put my client
out of business.

640
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:43,120
I didn't--

641
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:44,889
I don't--
- Answer the question.

642
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,291
I didn't ask how my lawyer
makes his ends meet,

643
00:23:47,327 --> 00:23:50,261
because I'm focused on mine.
- Let's focus on yours.

644
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:53,130
Because if I find out
that you knew they were driving

645
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,799
this lawsuit,
and you lied about it,

646
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:57,001
oh, I'm going to come
for your house.

647
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:58,314
And then, I'm going to come
for your pension--

648
00:23:58,338 --> 00:23:59,648
- Objection.
- And your daughter's

649
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:00,872
piggy bank.
- Badgering.

650
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:04,508
I'm not doing anything
a federal prosecutor won't do

651
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:06,344
if he doesn't tell the truth.
- Yes, you are.

652
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:08,145
You are pointing a gun
at my client's head,

653
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:09,658
and I'm pretty damn sure
you wouldn't like it

654
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:11,115
if I pointed a gun at yours.

655
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,060
Mr. Litt?

656
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,833
Mr. Litt?

657
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,804
Lay down and shut up.

658
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,307
And this time,
you don't give me your wallet

659
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:38,943
and give me your phone,
and keep your mouth shut,

660
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,711
I won't just kick you.

661
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:42,914
I'll pull this trigger,

662
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:46,050
and you'll never see anyone
you care about ever again.

663
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:52,123
Mr. Litt, for the last time,
do you have anything further?

664
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,294
Motions to dismiss and
change of venue are denied.

665
00:25:07,664 --> 00:25:09,997
You and I need to talk,
and we need to talk right now.

666
00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:11,466
No, we don't.

667
00:25:11,501 --> 00:25:13,634
And if you know what's good
for you, you'll get out.

668
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,903
I'm not going anywhere
until you explain to me

669
00:25:15,939 --> 00:25:18,806
how one minute, you're ready to
book one-way tickets to Omaha,

670
00:25:18,842 --> 00:25:20,720
and the next minute,
I find out we've all but lost.

671
00:25:20,744 --> 00:25:24,078
You weren't there.
You don't know what happened.

672
00:25:24,114 --> 00:25:27,415
I know that.
That's what I'm doing here.

673
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,584
- And I told you to get out.
- And I told you

674
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:32,153
I'm not going anywhere until
you tell me what happened.

675
00:25:32,188 --> 00:25:36,057
Listen to me.
I did the best I could,

676
00:25:36,092 --> 00:25:38,426
and I do not want to
talk about this anymore.

677
00:25:38,461 --> 00:25:40,461
The best you could?

678
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,963
You're not some
first-year associate.

679
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,898
You're a goddamn Name Partner

680
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:46,334
who bullied his way
on to my case.

681
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:48,147
And the next thing I know,
you've laid down like a dog,

682
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:51,672
let yourself get kicked--
- You weren't there!

683
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:55,543
You weren't there.

684
00:25:55,578 --> 00:25:58,513
You don't know
the shit I went through.

685
00:25:58,548 --> 00:26:00,014
You never will.

686
00:26:01,718 --> 00:26:02,850
Now back the hell off,

687
00:26:02,886 --> 00:26:04,419
and get the hell
out of my office.

688
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,491
Louis, relax.
I was just trying to--

689
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,226
Get the hell out!

690
00:26:37,654 --> 00:26:38,864
Harvey, can I talk to you
for a second?

691
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,621
Sure, what's on your mind?

692
00:26:40,657 --> 00:26:42,001
I just got a call
from Holly Cromwell.

693
00:26:42,025 --> 00:26:43,891
Don't tell me,
she's got another firm

694
00:26:43,927 --> 00:26:46,961
wanting to recruit you, and
you're looking to leverage us.

695
00:26:46,996 --> 00:26:49,897
- Harvey, this is serious.
- What is it?

696
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:51,766
She told me that
Alex Williams called her up,

697
00:26:51,801 --> 00:26:53,145
looking to see what he
could get in the marketplace.

698
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:54,535
- Bullshit.
- It's not bullshit.

699
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,815
He wants to know
what the odds are

700
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:57,905
of him getting his name
on the wall somewhere else.

701
00:26:57,941 --> 00:27:00,390
I don't believe it.
How could he do this to me?

702
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:03,091
Maybe instead of thinking
about how he could do this,

703
00:27:03,127 --> 00:27:04,493
you might want to
think about why.

704
00:27:04,528 --> 00:27:06,261
- I don't care why.
- Well, you should.

705
00:27:06,297 --> 00:27:08,008
Because you made it personal
between you and Zane,

706
00:27:08,032 --> 00:27:09,543
and Alex became nothing
but an afterthought.

707
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:10,944
How do you even know
about any of this?

708
00:27:10,968 --> 00:27:14,503
Because before he talked
to Holly, he talked to me.

709
00:27:14,538 --> 00:27:16,538
Which is why I know
that Zane went to Alex

710
00:27:16,574 --> 00:27:18,774
this morning and told him
if he didn't sign Paxson,

711
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:20,609
he'd never make Name Partner
here at all.

712
00:27:20,644 --> 00:27:22,377
Where is he?

713
00:27:22,413 --> 00:27:23,946
Harvey, if you confront Zane,

714
00:27:23,981 --> 00:27:25,392
it's just going to
make things worse.

715
00:27:25,416 --> 00:27:27,115
I don't care.
I am not going to let him

716
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:29,184
bully my guy into submission.

717
00:27:36,227 --> 00:27:38,060
Hang up the phone
right the hell now.

718
00:27:38,095 --> 00:27:39,928
Don't walk into my office
and tell me that.

719
00:27:39,964 --> 00:27:41,997
So I can't walk in here,
but you can walk into

720
00:27:42,032 --> 00:27:43,932
my guy's office
and threaten his career?

721
00:27:43,968 --> 00:27:46,401
I didn't threaten his career.
I just told him like it was.

722
00:27:46,437 --> 00:27:49,238
- That's not your call.
- Bullshit, it's not.

723
00:27:49,273 --> 00:27:50,617
I gave you an order, and if
you're not going to follow it,

724
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:52,541
I'm going to the next man down.

725
00:27:52,576 --> 00:27:54,387
And if he doesn't listen to me,
he's never getting my vote.

726
00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:55,878
So he's got to listen to you,

727
00:27:55,913 --> 00:27:57,157
but he doesn't
have to listen to me?

728
00:27:57,181 --> 00:27:59,815
What the hell do you think
Managing Partner means?

729
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,950
Well, if this
is what it means,

730
00:28:01,986 --> 00:28:03,919
then maybe I made a bad call

731
00:28:03,954 --> 00:28:05,954
in being gracious
and letting you have it.

732
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,423
You weren't being gracious.
You were recognizing reality.

733
00:28:08,459 --> 00:28:10,392
Which is that I'm better
at this than you.

734
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:12,294
And what you're better at

735
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:15,130
is doing whatever you feel like
doing at any goddamn minute.

736
00:28:15,165 --> 00:28:16,576
Well, what I feel
like saying right now is,

737
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,300
Alex is my guy.

738
00:28:18,335 --> 00:28:20,435
He does what I say,
and that's final.

739
00:28:20,471 --> 00:28:22,104
Well, that's too bad,
because I didn't do

740
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:23,005
what either one of you said,

741
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,573
and it's too late
to take it back.

742
00:28:24,608 --> 00:28:26,108
I don't believe this.

743
00:28:26,143 --> 00:28:27,976
Are you saying
you took another job?

744
00:28:28,012 --> 00:28:29,589
No, I'm saying I got someone
else to take another job.

745
00:28:29,613 --> 00:28:30,957
What the hell
are you talking about?

746
00:28:30,981 --> 00:28:33,282
CrytoGen wanted me
to trick their biggest asset

747
00:28:33,317 --> 00:28:35,150
into a lifetime of servitude.

748
00:28:35,185 --> 00:28:37,586
Instead, I informed him of
his right to go out on his own

749
00:28:37,621 --> 00:28:39,421
and signed him
as our newest client.

750
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:41,268
Are you out of your mind?
I told you to sign Paxson.

751
00:28:41,292 --> 00:28:43,158
And the reason
you gave both of us

752
00:28:43,193 --> 00:28:44,971
was that you didn't want us
dealing with them in bad faith.

753
00:28:44,995 --> 00:28:46,495
Well, now we didn't.

754
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,108
All we did was take a meeting
and not sign them.

755
00:28:48,132 --> 00:28:49,542
And you still
didn't do what I asked.

756
00:28:49,566 --> 00:28:51,266
And you didn't do
what I asked, either.

757
00:28:51,302 --> 00:28:53,168
You're right, I didn't.
Because if all you want

758
00:28:53,203 --> 00:28:54,681
is a yes man, then what
the hell am I doing here?

759
00:28:54,705 --> 00:28:56,349
- You listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.

760
00:28:56,373 --> 00:28:57,172
I signed a client
that's going to be worth

761
00:28:57,207 --> 00:28:59,441
a huge amount to this firm.

762
00:28:59,476 --> 00:29:02,444
I'm a hell of a goddamn lawyer,
and if you can't see that,

763
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:04,324
then I don't want to have
my name next to yours.

764
00:29:04,348 --> 00:29:06,615
- Alex--
- No, I said what I had to say.

765
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:09,117
As far as I'm concerned, you
two need to work your shit out.

766
00:29:14,258 --> 00:29:15,624
I don't know about you,

767
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:17,392
but I kind of like the guy
when he's angry.

768
00:29:17,428 --> 00:29:19,294
Yeah, you would,
because that's the same flavor

769
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,229
of bullshit
that you served Jessica.

770
00:29:27,471 --> 00:29:29,137
What now?

771
00:29:29,173 --> 00:29:31,006
I need to talk to you
about your partner.

772
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:33,508
- You mean Robert?
- I mean Louis Litt.

773
00:29:33,544 --> 00:29:36,011
- What about him?
- Something's wrong with him.

774
00:29:36,046 --> 00:29:37,590
And before you tell me
I don't know him,

775
00:29:37,614 --> 00:29:40,549
I'm telling you,
this isn't normal behavior.

776
00:29:40,584 --> 00:29:43,251
Even for a man
with his reputation.

777
00:29:43,287 --> 00:29:45,721
- How can you know that?
- How about I start by saying

778
00:29:45,756 --> 00:29:48,490
he stood up his own clients
at a meeting with Robert Zane?

779
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:50,425
And then somehow
shit the bed in court

780
00:29:50,461 --> 00:29:51,326
on a case he had in the bank.

781
00:29:51,362 --> 00:29:53,395
And I'm not even
going to get into

782
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,664
how he treated me when
I tried to ask him about it.

783
00:29:55,699 --> 00:29:57,666
Does anyone else
know about any of this?

784
00:29:57,701 --> 00:30:00,068
Judging by the look I saw
on his secretary's face,

785
00:30:00,104 --> 00:30:02,070
I'd say she does.

786
00:30:02,106 --> 00:30:04,639
I'd also say she's not
going to tell me a thing.

787
00:30:07,611 --> 00:30:10,212
Why are you telling me
about this, and not Robert?

788
00:30:11,615 --> 00:30:13,315
Because I may be new here,

789
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,684
but I know what friendship
looks like.

790
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:20,555
And right now, I'm telling you.
Louis Litt needs a friend.

791
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,134
- Harvey.
- Louis.

792
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:33,568
You got any plans tonight?

793
00:30:33,604 --> 00:30:35,604
I was thinking we could
go out for dinner.

794
00:30:35,639 --> 00:30:37,439
Oh, that's not
going to work for me.

795
00:30:37,474 --> 00:30:39,307
I have to get home to Sheila.
- Oh, come on.

796
00:30:39,343 --> 00:30:42,144
We've got some stuff
to catch up on.

797
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:43,712
- What stuff?
- From what I hear,

798
00:30:43,747 --> 00:30:45,380
you've had a rough couple days.

799
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:48,717
It's all good, Harvey.
Nothing to worry about.

800
00:30:48,752 --> 00:30:50,285
All good?
Come on.

801
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,454
I ask you to dinner
once in a blue moon,

802
00:30:52,489 --> 00:30:54,656
and whenever I do,
you drop everything.

803
00:30:54,691 --> 00:30:56,725
I used to,
but I have Sheila now,

804
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,994
so if you'll excuse me.

805
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:00,729
You're not leaving
until I get an answer.

806
00:31:00,764 --> 00:31:02,397
Don't hide behind Sheila.

807
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:06,134
- Get the hell off me!
- What's going on, Louis?

808
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:08,837
- Nothing.
- You can talk to me.

809
00:31:08,872 --> 00:31:12,140
- About what, there's nothing--
- Why'd you roll over in court?

810
00:31:12,176 --> 00:31:14,676
Why'd you no-show at dinner?
- Please stop.

811
00:31:14,711 --> 00:31:16,511
Why do you need me
to stop, Louis?

812
00:31:16,547 --> 00:31:20,415
What are you so scared of?
- God damn it, I was mugged.

813
00:31:20,451 --> 00:31:24,886
I was mugged, and I thought
I was going to die, okay?

814
00:31:26,657 --> 00:31:29,424
He had a gun...

815
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,793
that he had pressed
to the back of my head.

816
00:31:33,497 --> 00:31:36,198
I can still feel it.

817
00:31:36,233 --> 00:31:39,201
Is that what you want to hear?
Because that's what's going on.

818
00:31:39,236 --> 00:31:40,769
It's okay, buddy.
You're okay.

819
00:31:42,573 --> 00:31:46,041
But it's not okay, Harvey.
It's not, I'm a mess.

820
00:31:46,076 --> 00:31:47,776
I'd be a mess, too.
Anyone would.

821
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,813
- What if it doesn't go away?
- It will.

822
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:53,448
I don't know
how long it will take,

823
00:31:53,484 --> 00:31:56,618
or when it'll happen,
but I know one thing.

824
00:31:56,653 --> 00:31:58,364
It won't go away
if you don't talk about it,

825
00:31:58,388 --> 00:32:00,322
and I don't just mean therapy.
- Harvey--

826
00:32:00,357 --> 00:32:02,624
Look, you have people here
who care about you.

827
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:05,894
Don't hide it from them.
- I'm not telling Robert.

828
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:08,396
- Why not?
- Because you're my friend,

829
00:32:08,432 --> 00:32:10,832
and he's my boss,
and he just got here,

830
00:32:10,868 --> 00:32:12,901
and I cannot
have him see me as weak.

831
00:32:12,936 --> 00:32:15,837
He won't think you're weak.

832
00:32:15,873 --> 00:32:17,706
He'll think you're strong
for telling him.

833
00:32:17,741 --> 00:32:21,042
But I won't be strong.
I'm going to turn into this.

834
00:32:21,078 --> 00:32:23,712
Look at me, Harvey.
Look at me.

835
00:32:25,782 --> 00:32:27,849
I can't have him
see me like this.

836
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,586
Why don't I tell him for you?

837
00:32:31,622 --> 00:32:34,689
We've got some things
to work out between us anyway.

838
00:32:37,728 --> 00:32:39,728
Thank you, Harvey.
That would be nice.

839
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:04,060
- What is it, Donna?
- Robert, I have your report.

840
00:33:04,095 --> 00:33:05,828
But before you read it,
I need to tell you

841
00:33:05,864 --> 00:33:09,232
what I told you before.

842
00:33:09,267 --> 00:33:11,167
This isn't really what I do.

843
00:33:11,202 --> 00:33:13,970
- Why bring it to me at all?
- Because you asked for it.

844
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:16,283
And more importantly, what I do
is what you need right now.

845
00:33:16,307 --> 00:33:17,907
So let me get this straight.

846
00:33:17,942 --> 00:33:19,520
You're going to come in here
with a half-assed

847
00:33:19,544 --> 00:33:21,577
excuse for a report,
and then tell me what I need?

848
00:33:21,613 --> 00:33:23,412
Yeah, I am,
because while you wanted me

849
00:33:23,448 --> 00:33:25,359
to be spending my time
on something you could have

850
00:33:25,383 --> 00:33:29,118
hired an accounting firm for,
I was busy working my ass off

851
00:33:29,154 --> 00:33:32,588
maximizing revenue per square
foot the old fashioned way.

852
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:35,002
By keeping this place together.
- What are you talking about?

853
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:37,171
I'm just saying that between
picking a fight with Harvey,

854
00:33:37,195 --> 00:33:38,239
taking a client away
from Louis,

855
00:33:38,263 --> 00:33:40,263
and whatever else
you've been up to,

856
00:33:40,298 --> 00:33:41,475
you didn't notice that
one of your star attorneys

857
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:43,366
was thinking about leaving.

858
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:45,434
And now, thanks to me,
he's going to stay.

859
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,869
You're talking about Alex?

860
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:49,539
Yes, of course
I'm talking about Alex.

861
00:33:49,574 --> 00:33:52,308
Then Donna, I appreciate
what you did.

862
00:33:52,343 --> 00:33:54,677
But if he left, he left.
So be it.

863
00:33:54,712 --> 00:33:57,280
Because if I'm
going to lead this firm,

864
00:33:57,315 --> 00:33:59,115
people need to
follow my orders.

865
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,384
Maybe the problem isn't
with the orders, Robert,

866
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:03,452
Maybe it's with the man
who's giving them.

867
00:34:03,488 --> 00:34:07,356
You may not want to hear this,
but I'm going to say it anyway.

868
00:34:07,392 --> 00:34:10,459
You think that the reason
Rand and Kaldor turned on you

869
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:13,462
is because you had
a soft spot for us.

870
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:17,333
I think it's because you didn't
have a soft spot for them.

871
00:34:17,368 --> 00:34:19,302
And if you treat us
the way you treated them,

872
00:34:19,337 --> 00:34:21,137
the same thing's
going to happen here.

873
00:34:21,172 --> 00:34:24,407
I can't just let everyone
do what they want.

874
00:34:24,442 --> 00:34:26,375
It's not in me.

875
00:34:26,411 --> 00:34:29,412
I'm just saying, sometimes
we need to be smacked in line,

876
00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:32,481
and sometimes,
you need to let us do

877
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:34,650
what we do the way we do it.

878
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:43,326
I'm going to farm out
this revenue per square foot

879
00:34:43,361 --> 00:34:46,529
to an accounting firm.

880
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:48,331
Thanks, Robert.

881
00:34:50,435 --> 00:34:52,168
What?

882
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:54,937
I knew you did this
whisperer shit with Harvey,

883
00:34:54,973 --> 00:34:57,406
but I didn't think
you'd ever do it to me.

884
00:34:57,442 --> 00:34:59,575
I'm going to let you in
on a little secret, Zane.

885
00:34:59,611 --> 00:35:01,744
I do it to everybody.

886
00:35:13,424 --> 00:35:15,358
Alex, you got a second?

887
00:35:15,393 --> 00:35:17,360
That depends
on what you're here to say.

888
00:35:17,395 --> 00:35:18,961
I'm here to say I'm sorry.

889
00:35:18,997 --> 00:35:20,741
I put you in a position
that I shouldn't have,

890
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:23,366
but I also want to say

891
00:35:23,401 --> 00:35:25,234
you didn't have to talk
to that headhunter.

892
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:28,604
- Yeah, Harvey, I did.
- Why?

893
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,539
You want to know the truth?

894
00:35:30,575 --> 00:35:32,475
I had to know what kind
of leverage I had.

895
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,577
And it turns out,
there wasn't anybody willing

896
00:35:34,612 --> 00:35:37,079
to put my name on the wall
any faster than you.

897
00:35:37,115 --> 00:35:38,626
Which is what left me open
to hear Donna's bullshit.

898
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,249
What do you mean
Donna's bullshit?

899
00:35:40,285 --> 00:35:41,662
It's really your bullshit.
She said I was in

900
00:35:41,686 --> 00:35:44,453
a no-win situation, and I
could bitch and moan about it,

901
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:46,222
or I could
get out of it myself.

902
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:48,391
-<i> Kobayashi Maru.</i>
- Yeah.

903
00:35:48,426 --> 00:35:50,826
Yeah, well, you got
yourself out pretty damn well,

904
00:35:50,862 --> 00:35:52,728
and I'm not the only one
who thinks so.

905
00:35:52,764 --> 00:35:54,497
Zane was pretty impressed, too.

906
00:35:54,532 --> 00:35:57,466
Then I guess
I got the job done.

907
00:35:57,798 --> 00:35:59,475
And maybe I should have watched
a little "Star Trek"

908
00:35:59,499 --> 00:36:01,120
growing up after all.
- What?

909
00:36:01,121 --> 00:36:02,291
How could you
never watch "Star Trek?"

910
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:04,424
Because it's a stupid show
with shitty effects.

911
00:36:04,425 --> 00:36:05,813
You realize I love
that show, right?

912
00:36:05,814 --> 00:36:06,858
I don't care
how you feel about it.

913
00:36:06,882 --> 00:36:08,949
It's a stupid show
with shitty effects.

914
00:36:08,984 --> 00:36:11,017
You know what, Alex?
You may be a hell of a lawyer,

915
00:36:11,053 --> 00:36:12,931
but if you can't appreciate
the original "Star Trek,"

916
00:36:12,955 --> 00:36:14,554
you're nothing,
because Captain Kirk

917
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,823
is the best television
character ever created.

918
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:18,558
I've got two words for you,
mother----er.

919
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:20,327
Magnum, P.I.

920
00:36:20,362 --> 00:36:22,295
Those are fighting words.
You know that, right?

921
00:36:22,331 --> 00:36:24,965
They're not fighting words,
Harvey, they're drinking words.

922
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,900
So sit on down,
and let's hash this out

923
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:29,803
like two people who can both
appreciate "M-A-S-H."

924
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:31,805
Sounds good to me.

925
00:36:48,991 --> 00:36:51,258
- Robert.
- Before you say anything,

926
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:53,827
let me just say that
I'm sorry for what happened,

927
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:55,896
and I'm more sorry
for how I treated you.

928
00:36:55,931 --> 00:36:57,831
I appreciate that, Robert.

929
00:36:57,866 --> 00:36:59,699
But this was my fault,
not yours.

930
00:36:59,735 --> 00:37:02,869
Louis, this is not
your fault.

931
00:37:02,905 --> 00:37:05,438
And I want you to know
you could have come to me.

932
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:08,008
I just felt so powerless.

933
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:09,843
Of course you did.
You were a victim.

934
00:37:09,878 --> 00:37:12,345
But that doesn't mean
you have to feel like one.

935
00:37:12,381 --> 00:37:14,414
How can I not feel like one?

936
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:17,884
Louis, I'm going to tell you
something nobody knows.

937
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,387
I grew up in a rough place
with rough people.

938
00:37:20,422 --> 00:37:23,023
Don't tell me that you know
what it's like to get mugged?

939
00:37:23,058 --> 00:37:24,802
No, what I'm trying to tell
you is I know what it's like

940
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,027
to be on the other end of it.
- What?

941
00:37:27,062 --> 00:37:28,728
I was 14 years old.

942
00:37:28,764 --> 00:37:31,932
My friends were all I knew,
and I loved them.

943
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:37,203
But they were messed up.

944
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:39,039
And one night,
they get it in their heads

945
00:37:39,074 --> 00:37:40,774
that they're going
to roll somebody,

946
00:37:40,809 --> 00:37:43,243
and I got caught up in it.

947
00:37:43,278 --> 00:37:45,979
The guy fought back.
We had no choice.

948
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,654
We beat him good,
put him in the hospital.

949
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:50,216
- Jesus.
- I know.

950
00:37:50,252 --> 00:37:52,152
And I only did it once,

951
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:55,055
and it's haunted me
my whole life.

952
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,823
It still does.

953
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,792
Are you saying that
I should feel sorry

954
00:37:58,827 --> 00:38:00,260
for the man who mugged me?

955
00:38:00,295 --> 00:38:02,829
No, no, no,
I'm not saying that, Louis.

956
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,398
I'm saying that someday,

957
00:38:05,434 --> 00:38:08,101
he's going to have to face up
to who he is,

958
00:38:08,136 --> 00:38:10,070
and he'll carry that shame
for a lifetime.

959
00:38:10,105 --> 00:38:12,472
But you don't have to,
because this doesn't have

960
00:38:12,507 --> 00:38:15,675
a single thing to do
with who you are.

961
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:18,144
You hearing me?
- I'm hearing you.

962
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,414
Good, and Louis,
we are a family here.

963
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:24,784
So from now on,
I want you to remember

964
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,988
you can share things
with your family.

965
00:38:28,023 --> 00:38:29,923
- Okay.
- I mean, for God's sake.

966
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:31,658
You didn't think twice
about telling me

967
00:38:31,693 --> 00:38:34,027
you were tapping your woman.
- That's a fair point.

968
00:38:40,202 --> 00:38:43,870
Uh, okay.
Good man.

969
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,372
You heading home
for the night?

970
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:47,807
- I was, why?
- I just wanted to let you know

971
00:38:47,843 --> 00:38:50,143
I talked to Alex,
and that it's all good.

972
00:38:50,178 --> 00:38:53,179
- That's great, Harvey.
- There's just one thing.

973
00:38:53,215 --> 00:38:55,281
It turns out that he
didn't call Holly Cromwell.

974
00:38:55,317 --> 00:38:58,118
She called him.
- So?

975
00:38:58,153 --> 00:39:01,354
So, if she called him,
why would she then call you

976
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:04,924
and say he called her?
- I guess she wouldn't.

977
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,928
I guess I must have called her,
and told her to call him.

978
00:39:08,964 --> 00:39:11,464
- Mind if I ask why?
- Because, Harvey.

979
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,134
Sometimes people just
need to know where they stand.

980
00:39:14,169 --> 00:39:16,002
And what if he'd been able
to leverage himself

981
00:39:16,038 --> 00:39:17,837
into Name Partner
somewhere else?

982
00:39:17,873 --> 00:39:19,406
Then you and Robert Zane
would learn

983
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:21,174
that if you can't
figure your shit out,

984
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:23,476
the only people who are
going to get hurt are you.

985
00:39:37,893 --> 00:39:39,959
Samantha,
what are you doing here?

986
00:39:39,995 --> 00:39:42,429
I want to talk to you.

987
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:44,097
Look, if this
is about earlier--

988
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,766
It is about earlier,
but not how you think.

989
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:49,102
I came here to tell you
that the same thing

990
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,337
that happened to you
happened to me.

991
00:39:51,373 --> 00:39:53,206
- Robert told you, didn't he?
- He did.

992
00:39:53,241 --> 00:39:55,375
And when it happened,
he was there for me.

993
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,177
So now, I'm going
to be there for you.

994
00:39:57,212 --> 00:39:58,890
I'm sorry, what do you mean
he was there for you?

995
00:39:58,914 --> 00:40:00,547
That's not important.
What is important

996
00:40:00,582 --> 00:40:03,016
is you're going to start
learning self-defense.

997
00:40:03,051 --> 00:40:04,451
And you're going to start
right now.

998
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:06,453
I really appreciate
you coming by, okay?

999
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:08,521
But I'm going to go inside.

1000
00:40:08,557 --> 00:40:10,490
Tell me the truth.

1001
00:40:10,525 --> 00:40:12,303
When you saw me standing there,
and you couldn't make out

1002
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,527
whether it was me or not,
you were scared, right?

1003
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,998
I don't want to learn
self-defense.

1004
00:40:19,034 --> 00:40:21,367
Do me a favor.
Try to hit me.

1005
00:40:21,403 --> 00:40:24,804
- I'm not going to hit you.
- Try to hit me.

1006
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,206
Okay.

1007
00:40:26,241 --> 00:40:27,874
Ready?
Boop.

1008
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:29,287
That's pretty crazy, right--
- Would you just

1009
00:40:29,311 --> 00:40:31,444
try to hit me?
- All right, fine.

1010
00:40:33,381 --> 00:40:35,548
All right, mother--

1011
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,617
Oh, my God.

1012
00:40:37,652 --> 00:40:39,419
You could kill someone,
couldn't you?

1013
00:40:39,454 --> 00:40:42,956
Probably, but the point is,
they couldn't kill me.

1014
00:40:42,991 --> 00:40:46,559
Now, get up, it's time
for your first lesson.

1015
00:40:46,595 --> 00:40:49,662
First things first, you got to
be aware of your surroundings,

1016
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:51,564
and you got to learn
how to stand.

1017
00:40:56,638 --> 00:40:58,505
Okay.

1018
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,573
Show me.
- Okay.

1019
00:41:00,609 --> 00:41:02,408
You want to
stabilize your core,

1020
00:41:02,444 --> 00:41:04,677
so one foot
slightly behind the other,

1021
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:06,246
about hip-width apart.

1022
00:41:06,281 --> 00:41:07,592
See how it stabilizes?
- The core.

1023
00:41:07,616 --> 00:41:08,960
- Yeah.
- Okay, so how many calories

1024
00:41:08,984 --> 00:41:10,517
have I burned just now?

1025
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:12,118
Three.

1026
00:41:12,154 --> 00:41:13,686
Just because
you're talking so much.

1027
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:15,655
- Right, okay.
- Yeah.

1028
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,257
All right.
- Uh--

1029
00:41:17,292 --> 00:41:18,625
Now smack me.
