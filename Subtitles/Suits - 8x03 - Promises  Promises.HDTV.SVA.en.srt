1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,116
<i>Previously on "Suits"...</i>

2
00:00:01,366 --> 00:00:02,734
I'm here because
I want you to come home.

3
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:03,525
Back to the firm?

4
00:00:03,526 --> 00:00:04,673
Yes, and not only that,

5
00:00:04,674 --> 00:00:05,955
you can get the ten
best associates

6
00:00:05,956 --> 00:00:07,630
from Robert Zane's
stable to come with you.

7
00:00:07,631 --> 00:00:08,939
And what's in this for me?

8
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,906
I'll make sure that you are
the youngest senior partner

9
00:00:10,907 --> 00:00:11,705
we've ever had.

10
00:00:11,706 --> 00:00:14,311
As of this morning,
we're merging with Robert Zane.

11
00:00:14,312 --> 00:00:15,624
When I came over,
you said my name

12
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:16,958
would be the
one to go up next.

13
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,859
You have my word.

14
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:19,260
Your name goes up next.

15
00:00:19,262 --> 00:00:21,095
Alex, what are you doing?

16
00:00:21,097 --> 00:00:22,730
I'm going through every one
of Samantha Wheeler's files,

17
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:24,765
'cause a fight's coming,
and I'm gonna be ready.

18
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:27,068
Katrina, are you sure
you're gonna be okay

19
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,936
firing people
you've worked with for years?

20
00:00:28,938 --> 00:00:30,004
I'll tell you
what I told Louis,

21
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:32,006
that if I'm going to grow
in my role here,

22
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:33,808
this is something I'm going
to have to learn to do.

23
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,043
I gave you an order,
and you blatantly ignored me.

24
00:00:36,045 --> 00:00:38,045
I did do what you
originally asked:

25
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:40,092
to objectively evaluate
the associates.

26
00:00:40,093 --> 00:00:42,226
I don't care.
Brian is staying.

27
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:44,929
Gavin Andrews is a hell of a
lot more than meets the eye.

28
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:47,799
And a guy with your history
would want to be more careful

29
00:00:47,801 --> 00:00:49,867
about who he gets
into bed with.

30
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:50,902
Tell me what
you're talking about,

31
00:00:50,904 --> 00:00:53,237
or get out
of my goddamn office.

32
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:55,707
I admit I'm starting to see
what you see in her.

33
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:57,075
That's all I was hoping for.

34
00:00:57,077 --> 00:00:58,743
Now I can tell you
why I was hoping it.

35
00:00:58,745 --> 00:01:00,144
What haven't you told me?

36
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:01,879
Her name goes
up on the wall next.

37
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:06,641
I mean,
how was I supposed to know

38
00:01:06,642 --> 00:01:07,841
she was married?
- I don't know,

39
00:01:07,843 --> 00:01:09,676
maybe her wedding ring
could have tipped you off.

40
00:01:09,678 --> 00:01:10,844
Mm.

41
00:01:10,846 --> 00:01:13,313
I was 23, you know?

42
00:01:13,315 --> 00:01:15,015
I wasn't looking
at no damn rings.

43
00:01:15,017 --> 00:01:17,484
You really had some balls
when you were younger.

44
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:19,920
Still do,
thank you very much.

45
00:01:19,922 --> 00:01:22,322
Now, why don't you get to it?

46
00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:24,958
- Why don't I get to what?
- Harvey, you've got plenty

47
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,228
of friends to have drinks with,
most of them prettier than me.

48
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,663
You've got something
on your mind.

49
00:01:29,665 --> 00:01:32,232
Let's hear it.
- Robert, do you remember

50
00:01:32,234 --> 00:01:33,934
when you told me
you promised Samantha

51
00:01:33,936 --> 00:01:35,769
her name would go up next?
- I do.

52
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:39,406
I made Alex the same promise.

53
00:01:39,408 --> 00:01:42,509
- Why you telling me now?
- Because we're partners.

54
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:46,646
I don't want to keep
any secrets from my partner.

55
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,182
Then I guess there's only
one thing to do.

56
00:01:49,184 --> 00:01:51,685
- What's that?
- Kick the can down the road.

57
00:01:51,687 --> 00:01:53,854
Because there's no way
both of us are gonna be able

58
00:01:53,856 --> 00:01:56,123
to keep that promise,
and for all we know,

59
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,825
one of them could get hit
by a bus before we have

60
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,627
to make that call.
- Then I guess

61
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:01,962
it's a good thing
both our names

62
00:02:01,964 --> 00:02:05,165
are already up there.
- Sure is.

63
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:08,368
- Another drink?
- Yeah, make it a double.

64
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,270
And where are you going?

65
00:02:10,272 --> 00:02:13,740
To make room for that double.

66
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,343
Excuse me, would you mind
giving me a minute to...?

67
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:19,880
Oh, I'm so sorry, I--
I didn't hear you come in.

68
00:02:19,882 --> 00:02:23,283
Um, I'll just go.
- Are you all right?

69
00:02:23,285 --> 00:02:24,885
Uh, yeah.

70
00:02:24,887 --> 00:02:27,988
I, um--I just got a phone call.

71
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,390
Um, it's not important.

72
00:02:30,392 --> 00:02:32,526
Excuse me.
- No, you stay.

73
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:34,361
I'll use the one downstairs.

74
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:37,364
Take as long as you need.

75
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,901
For what it's worth...

76
00:02:40,903 --> 00:02:43,236
I hope everything's okay.

77
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:48,675
Thank you.

78
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,113
What are you doing
in my home?

79
00:02:53,115 --> 00:02:55,682
I'm here because I have a way
to get your Renoir back,

80
00:02:55,684 --> 00:02:57,350
but I'm gonna need something
from you.

81
00:02:57,352 --> 00:02:59,252
- And what exactly is that?
- Give your ex the villa

82
00:02:59,254 --> 00:03:01,588
in Bordeaux, and guarantee
she never pays a nickel

83
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,890
of upkeep.
- And why would I do that?

84
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,692
Because you asked me
to get that painting back

85
00:03:05,694 --> 00:03:07,327
and this is the only way
that's gonna happen.

86
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:08,962
No, I mean
why would I do that

87
00:03:08,964 --> 00:03:11,531
when your firm is about
to sign my biggest competitor?

88
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:13,667
- What are you talking about?
- I just learned

89
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:15,502
Samantha Wheeler's about
to sign Delta.

90
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:16,937
- God damn it.
- See, I thought

91
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:18,672
I made it clear
that if I sign with you

92
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:20,273
it is because I trust you.

93
00:03:20,275 --> 00:03:22,275
Using me as a stalking horse
doesn't make me feel like

94
00:03:22,277 --> 00:03:23,710
I can trust you.
- Gavin, that's not

95
00:03:23,712 --> 00:03:25,445
what's going on here.
- I told you,

96
00:03:25,447 --> 00:03:27,614
that painting
is personal to me.

97
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,549
I'm gonna tell you why.

98
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:31,184
My father was not
a wealthy man,

99
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:33,253
but he had an education.

100
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,721
If there's one thing
he appreciated

101
00:03:34,723 --> 00:03:37,490
more than anything, it was art.

102
00:03:37,492 --> 00:03:39,326
Every Sunday, we'd go
to a different gallery.

103
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:40,860
We'd walk through--
he would tell me

104
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:43,296
everything he knew
about every painting there was.

105
00:03:43,298 --> 00:03:45,298
You know who
his favorite artist was?

106
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,967
Renoir.

107
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:48,969
I paid $8 million
for that painting.

108
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:52,472
It's worth twice that now,
but I would never sell it...

109
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:57,777
because every time
I look at it...

110
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,646
I think of him.

111
00:03:59,648 --> 00:04:02,382
Gavin, I told you
I'll get that painting back

112
00:04:02,384 --> 00:04:03,583
and I will.

113
00:04:03,585 --> 00:04:05,085
And I'll tell you
something else--

114
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:06,620
There's no way
Samantha Wheeler's signing

115
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:08,788
Delta goddamn Airlines.

116
00:04:11,994 --> 00:04:14,094
Thanks.

117
00:04:14,096 --> 00:04:16,730
Alex, what a pleasant surprise.

118
00:04:16,732 --> 00:04:18,298
Cut the bullshit.

119
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,100
I just found out you're going
after Delta Airlines.

120
00:04:20,102 --> 00:04:21,901
Not just going after,
it's practically a done deal.

121
00:04:21,903 --> 00:04:24,104
That was fast,
since you only talked to Delta

122
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:26,172
after you found out
I was pursuing Gavin Andrews.

123
00:04:26,174 --> 00:04:27,641
One had nothing
to do with the other.

124
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:29,743
And I said cut the bullshit.

125
00:04:29,745 --> 00:04:32,145
You did this because you knew
you'd either sign Delta

126
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,414
and I'd be out in the cold,
or Gavin Andrews

127
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,283
would accuse me of using him
as a stalking horse

128
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:38,685
and I'd be out in the cold.
- If you're so sure of that,

129
00:04:38,687 --> 00:04:40,287
then what are you doing
standing here

130
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:42,188
ruining my morning bagel?
- I'm here to tell you

131
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,556
to back the hell off.

132
00:04:43,558 --> 00:04:44,391
Well, that's not
gonna happen.

133
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:45,425
Listen to me.

134
00:04:45,427 --> 00:04:46,493
I don't know
how you did things before,

135
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,762
but around here,
we don't stab each other

136
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:49,996
in the back.
- Then what do you call

137
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,499
going after my old client
for the sole purpose

138
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,868
of making me look bad?

139
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,703
Because I'm not gonna
let that slide.

140
00:04:56,705 --> 00:04:58,805
Not to mention I warned you

141
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:00,206
Gavin Andrews
isn't worth the trouble.

142
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,174
You don't want to look bad,

143
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,575
or the client's
too much trouble?

144
00:05:02,577 --> 00:05:04,344
Which one is it?
- It's both,

145
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,146
and if you can't see that
then it's not my problem.

146
00:05:06,148 --> 00:05:09,349
What I see is you standing
between me and a client,

147
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,985
and if I were you, I'd get
the hell out of the way.

148
00:05:11,987 --> 00:05:13,687
Well, then you'd better
sign your guy fast,

149
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,155
because I'm already on
the one-yard line with mine

150
00:05:15,157 --> 00:05:17,761
and I'm about to punch it in.

Hey.

163
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,120
Good morning, Robert.
- It will be

164
00:06:02,122 --> 00:06:04,322
once this damn hangover
wears off.

165
00:06:04,324 --> 00:06:07,458
- Out late last night, yo?
- Uh, no, I was here

166
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,061
forgetting my age
and matching Harvey

167
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:11,729
drink for drink.

168
00:06:11,731 --> 00:06:13,598
Now, what can I do for you?
- Robert, you know,

169
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,299
if you're hungover, I can whip
up my nana's special remedy.

170
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:17,368
I just need some sugar, tea,
a little steamed milk,

171
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,803
and, of course,
two of my cuticles.

172
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:20,471
Thanks, but I'd rather
have the hangover.

173
00:06:20,473 --> 00:06:21,839
It's about the tea, isn't it?

174
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:23,041
Because she's from
the old country

175
00:06:23,043 --> 00:06:24,475
and I can substitute--
- Louis.

176
00:06:24,477 --> 00:06:26,678
What in God's name
did you come in here for?

177
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,479
Okay. Robert.

178
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:30,815
The other day
when I was feeling left out,

179
00:06:30,817 --> 00:06:34,085
you and Harvey let me know
that you clocked me.

180
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:36,521
Well, I realized
that there's someone

181
00:06:36,523 --> 00:06:38,423
that I haven't been clocking.

182
00:06:38,425 --> 00:06:40,191
- What are you talking about?
- When I brought Katrina over

183
00:06:40,193 --> 00:06:42,493
from you, I told her
that she was gonna be

184
00:06:42,495 --> 00:06:43,995
the youngest senior partner
in firm history,

185
00:06:43,997 --> 00:06:45,897
and I want
to fulfill that promise.

186
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:47,165
Now, let me
get this straight:

187
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:49,500
you're holding me
to a promise you made to her

188
00:06:49,502 --> 00:06:51,202
so that you could steal her
from me.

189
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:52,804
Robert, that's not the point
and you know it.

190
00:06:52,806 --> 00:06:55,373
Katrina is a great lawyer,
and it's time.

191
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,875
Maybe it is time,
but senior partner

192
00:06:57,877 --> 00:07:00,344
isn't just "lawyering," Louis.

193
00:07:00,346 --> 00:07:02,280
It's about managing people,
and I don't know

194
00:07:02,282 --> 00:07:03,915
how good Katrina Bennett is
with people.

195
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:05,550
Well, then you tell me.

196
00:07:05,552 --> 00:07:07,919
What can she do
to prove herself to you?

197
00:07:11,925 --> 00:07:13,558
Excuse me, Mr. Specter?

198
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,227
- I know you, you're--
- From last night.

199
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:17,862
I, uh...

200
00:07:17,864 --> 00:07:19,864
wanted to return this.

201
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:21,733
You were very kind.
Thank you.

202
00:07:21,735 --> 00:07:23,067
It's nothing.
I was just hoping

203
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:25,069
everything was okay.
- Actually,

204
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:27,205
that's the reason
that I'm here.

205
00:07:27,207 --> 00:07:29,640
- What do you mean?
- I was upset last night

206
00:07:29,642 --> 00:07:31,976
because I got a call
from my mother.

207
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:35,413
She needs an operation,
and I can't afford it.

208
00:07:35,415 --> 00:07:36,881
What are you asking me?

209
00:07:36,883 --> 00:07:39,117
I've worked
enough overtime hours

210
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:41,119
to make having
that operation possible,

211
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:43,755
but they won't pay me overtime
because my title

212
00:07:43,757 --> 00:07:46,290
is Facilities Manager.

213
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:47,992
I don't manage anything.

214
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:50,294
I was hoping maybe...
- I'd be able

215
00:07:50,296 --> 00:07:53,498
to get you your money.
- Yes.

216
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,566
- Listen, Miss...?
- Anna.

217
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:58,269
Anna Reed.
- Anna, your employer

218
00:07:58,271 --> 00:08:00,838
is my landlord,
so if I get involved

219
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,607
things could get
very complicated.

220
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:06,077
But it's a simple matter
of paying me for my work.

221
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,912
If that were true,
why would he listen to me

222
00:08:07,914 --> 00:08:09,981
when he didn't listen to you?

223
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,817
Because people like me
don't matter

224
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:14,819
to people like them.

225
00:08:14,821 --> 00:08:18,589
I'm just the lady
that cleans their toilet.

226
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:20,758
Please, Mr. Specter.

227
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,495
I'm not proud
to ask you for this

228
00:08:24,497 --> 00:08:26,998
but my mother needs this,
and when it comes

229
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,500
to taking care of people
we love,

230
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:32,837
pride has no place.

231
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:35,173
Okay.

232
00:08:35,175 --> 00:08:38,142
I can't promise anything,
but I'll try.

233
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:39,277
Thank you.

234
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,313
I knew you were kind.

235
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:50,221
Don't tell me you're dating
the cleaning woman now.

236
00:08:50,223 --> 00:08:53,357
- And what if I was?
- I'd say congratulations.

237
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:54,959
But why don't you tell me
why she was here.

238
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:56,861
I ran into her
in the bathroom last night.

239
00:08:56,863 --> 00:08:58,462
She was crying.

240
00:08:58,464 --> 00:09:00,031
The building isn't paying her
what she's owed,

241
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:01,566
and she asked me
to look into it.

242
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:03,401
You mean, she asked you
to pick a fight

243
00:09:03,403 --> 00:09:04,869
with our landlord,
who I shouldn't have

244
00:09:04,871 --> 00:09:06,637
to tell you
is a mean son of a bitch,

245
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,639
and this is a bad idea.
- Robert, I'm not an idiot,

246
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:10,842
and I'm not picking any fights
with David Fox.

247
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:12,677
I'm gonna talk to the man
for two minutes.

248
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,346
If he doesn't see it my way,
that's it.

249
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:17,815
Trust me.

250
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:19,684
Okay, Harvey.

251
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:22,820
I trust you.

252
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:31,429
There you are.
Been looking all over for you.

253
00:09:31,431 --> 00:09:34,065
Louis, if there's any chance
whatever it is can wait...

254
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:35,333
It can't.
I need you to supervise

255
00:09:35,335 --> 00:09:36,734
Brian Altman.
- What?

256
00:09:36,736 --> 00:09:38,336
Louis, I am in the middle
of a case,

257
00:09:38,338 --> 00:09:40,037
and there is a huge meeting
in an hour.

258
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,072
Well, then have him
help you with it.

259
00:09:41,074 --> 00:09:42,773
I don't need any help,
and I can't

260
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:44,175
be mentoring someone right now.

261
00:09:44,177 --> 00:09:45,843
It's not mentoring;
it's managing.

262
00:09:45,845 --> 00:09:48,079
Then have someone else
manage him.

263
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:49,213
Damn it, Katrina,
this is your chance

264
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:51,382
to be senior partner.

265
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:52,850
- Oh, my God.
- That's right.

266
00:09:52,852 --> 00:09:54,218
I just talked to Robert Zane
about making good

267
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,920
on my promise to you.
and I shouldn't even

268
00:09:55,922 --> 00:09:57,021
be telling you this--
no one can know.

269
00:09:57,023 --> 00:09:58,856
He's on board
as long as you can show

270
00:09:58,858 --> 00:10:00,958
that you are a manager.

271
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,860
Okay, uh...

272
00:10:02,862 --> 00:10:04,428
Look, then just do me a favor.

273
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,397
Please just tell Brian
to familiarize himself

274
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,065
with Bigelow Textiles
and meet me

275
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:10,067
in the conference room
in 45 minutes.

276
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:12,236
Katrina,
is something going on?

277
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:13,504
Why would something
be going on?

278
00:10:13,506 --> 00:10:14,972
I don't know,
'cause I just told you

279
00:10:14,974 --> 00:10:16,007
that your dreams
are coming true

280
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:18,442
and it looks like
you ate a bad clam.

281
00:10:18,444 --> 00:10:20,544
I'm sorry, Louis.

282
00:10:20,546 --> 00:10:24,215
This is amazing news.
I'm just crunched for time.

283
00:10:24,217 --> 00:10:26,817
So, please, just tell Brian
to be there

284
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:30,254
and I will handle him
from here on out.

285
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:32,690
Okay, I'll let him know.

286
00:10:38,898 --> 00:10:40,498
David Fox.

287
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,066
I'm Harvey Specter.

288
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:44,068
Of, uh, Something,
Something, Specter Litt?

289
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,803
Don't tell me
us changing our name

290
00:10:45,805 --> 00:10:48,406
is gonna be an issue again.
- No, it's not.

291
00:10:48,408 --> 00:10:50,408
Donna Paulsen saw to that
in your new lease.

292
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,310
Well, Donna has a way
of getting what she wants.

293
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:53,978
Speaking of what people want,
why don't you tell me

294
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,780
why you're here.
- I need your help.

295
00:10:55,782 --> 00:10:57,548
There's a cleaning woman
on our floor

296
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,483
who can't afford to pay
her mother's medical bills.

297
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:02,286
Turns out technically
she's a facilities manager,

298
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:04,455
which means she's not eligible
to make overtime.

299
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:06,123
A maid
with a manager's title.

300
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,858
I mean, sounds to me
like she's being empowered.

301
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,094
You and I both know
that title is just a way

302
00:11:10,096 --> 00:11:11,829
to get around paying
what she's earned.

303
00:11:11,831 --> 00:11:13,631
- I don't know any such thing.
- Oh, bullshit.

304
00:11:13,633 --> 00:11:14,665
She's your employee.
- Wrong.

305
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:15,900
I contract
all my cleaning services out

306
00:11:15,902 --> 00:11:18,302
to another company,
a company I don't run.

307
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:20,104
You're gonna tell me
that company is anything more

308
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:21,572
than a piece of paper
and a PO Box?

309
00:11:21,574 --> 00:11:22,974
Why don't you pay them
a visit and find out?

310
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:24,775
Listen, David,
all I'm asking

311
00:11:24,777 --> 00:11:26,310
is do the right thing.

312
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:28,145
Pay her for her work.
- You know,

313
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:29,714
why don't you reach
into your own pocket?

314
00:11:29,716 --> 00:11:30,948
'Cause that's what
you're asking me to do.

315
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,451
And I do this for her,
I gotta do it for everyone.

316
00:11:33,453 --> 00:11:34,885
And if you don't
do it for her,

317
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:36,620
you will have to do it
for everyone.

318
00:11:36,622 --> 00:11:38,789
You'd better watch
what you say to me,

319
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,358
'cause in case you forgot,
you're still living

320
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,226
under my roof.
- And if you don't back off,

321
00:11:42,228 --> 00:11:44,428
I'll take that roof
and everything else you have,

322
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,397
because you just violated
half-a-dozen laws

323
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,399
by threatening a tenant.
- You want to take me on,

324
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:50,568
you go for it,
'cause I didn't get where I am

325
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,103
by letting people like you
push me around.

326
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:53,971
Last time,
Donna kicked your ass.

327
00:11:53,973 --> 00:11:55,706
Well, I'm not Donna,

328
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:59,176
so you pay my client
what you owe her.

329
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:03,848
- Alex.
- We need to talk

330
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,750
about Samantha Wheeler.

331
00:12:05,752 --> 00:12:07,918
- What does that mean?
- It means she's making a play

332
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,021
for Delta Airlines,
and I want you to stop her.

333
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:12,023
Delta would be a huge client;
why would I want to stop her?

334
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:13,657
Because she only went
after them to stop me

335
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:15,159
from signing Gavin Andrews,
and team mates

336
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:16,560
don't do that to each other.

337
00:12:16,562 --> 00:12:18,229
This team mate talk
sounds great,

338
00:12:18,231 --> 00:12:19,930
but you just went after
one of her old clients.

339
00:12:19,932 --> 00:12:21,732
I didn't choose Gavin
because he was hers.

340
00:12:21,734 --> 00:12:23,901
I chose Gavin because
he was the most valuable client

341
00:12:23,903 --> 00:12:25,503
to Robert Zane.

342
00:12:25,505 --> 00:12:27,138
The fact that he was hers
just wasn't gonna stop me.

343
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,706
Wasn't gonna stop you,
or was icing on the cake?

344
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,274
What difference
does that make?

345
00:12:30,276 --> 00:12:32,109
Well, considering
what you're asking me to do,

346
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:33,744
it makes all the difference.
- Louis, after Zane ended up

347
00:12:33,746 --> 00:12:36,180
as managing partner
I wanted to take her on,

348
00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:38,582
but you said I should make
a friend of Zane instead.

349
00:12:38,584 --> 00:12:40,451
So I went after Gavin
to impress Robert,

350
00:12:40,453 --> 00:12:42,453
and if you're not
gonna stop her, I might as well

351
00:12:42,455 --> 00:12:43,621
just have gone after her
in the first place.

352
00:12:43,623 --> 00:12:45,356
All right, Alex, okay.

353
00:12:45,358 --> 00:12:47,258
But giving up a client
with eight-figure billables

354
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,293
is going out on one hell
of a limb, so I do this,

355
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:51,028
you better deliver
Gavin Andrews.

356
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,596
I will, Louis.

357
00:12:52,598 --> 00:12:54,732
You have my word.

358
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,241
Samantha Wheeler.

359
00:13:03,243 --> 00:13:04,843
You and I need
to have a little chat.

360
00:13:04,845 --> 00:13:06,511
Louis Litt.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

361
00:13:06,513 --> 00:13:09,014
- Oh, you know who I am.
- Well, a man like yourself

362
00:13:09,016 --> 00:13:11,716
needs no introduction.
- That is very kind of you,

363
00:13:11,718 --> 00:13:13,418
but I'm not here for you
to blow smoke up my ass.

364
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,520
Let me guess:
Alex realized

365
00:13:15,522 --> 00:13:16,955
he wasn't gonna stop me
on his own.

366
00:13:16,957 --> 00:13:18,523
He realized
that you were trying

367
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:20,225
to undermine him, which is why
I'm here to tell you

368
00:13:20,227 --> 00:13:21,860
that you're gonna stop
pursuing Delta.

369
00:13:21,862 --> 00:13:23,762
I don't believe this.

370
00:13:23,764 --> 00:13:25,263
Are you seriously
coming in here to tell me

371
00:13:25,265 --> 00:13:28,166
I can't sign one of the world's
biggest airlines?

372
00:13:28,168 --> 00:13:29,401
Yeah, I am.

373
00:13:29,403 --> 00:13:33,805
And this isn't a discussion;
it's an order.

374
00:13:33,807 --> 00:13:35,874
I hope you've had a chance

375
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:37,409
to think long

376
00:13:37,411 --> 00:13:40,212
and hard about this.

377
00:13:40,214 --> 00:13:42,747
Because I'd be careful
what you wish for.

378
00:13:42,749 --> 00:13:44,716
You trying to intimidate me?

379
00:13:44,718 --> 00:13:46,551
Just giving you
a little advice.

380
00:13:46,553 --> 00:13:48,420
Well, listen here,
sweet face.

381
00:13:48,422 --> 00:13:50,055
I get it.

382
00:13:50,057 --> 00:13:51,156
You're the it girl.

383
00:13:51,158 --> 00:13:53,291
Well, you know who I am?

384
00:13:53,293 --> 00:13:54,659
I'm Litt man.

385
00:13:54,661 --> 00:13:57,462
And you can try to sashay
your six-foot frame around here

386
00:13:57,464 --> 00:14:00,732
like you're Brigitte Nielsen
in 1985--

387
00:14:00,734 --> 00:14:03,568
turn me into a puddle,
get me to capitulate.

388
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,405
Well, I got news for you:
it's not gonna happen.

389
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:09,741
All right.

390
00:14:09,743 --> 00:14:11,843
I'll drop Delta.

391
00:14:11,845 --> 00:14:13,278
I knew you'd see things
my way.

392
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,481
But someday...

393
00:14:16,483 --> 00:14:19,751
you're gonna come asking
for a favor.

394
00:14:19,753 --> 00:14:24,389
Might not be today,
might not be tomorrow,

395
00:14:24,391 --> 00:14:26,892
but it's gonna happen...

396
00:14:26,894 --> 00:14:29,261
and when it does...

397
00:14:29,263 --> 00:14:32,531
I'm gonna remember
this conversation.

398
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:35,066
And Louis?

399
00:14:35,068 --> 00:14:37,302
If you think I couldn't
turn you into a puddle,

400
00:14:37,304 --> 00:14:41,006
you are wildly mistaken.

401
00:14:41,008 --> 00:14:42,574
So we're clear.
You'll drop the client.

402
00:14:42,576 --> 00:14:45,944
I have to go somewhere now.
- Mm.

403
00:14:45,946 --> 00:14:48,780
I'm sure you do.

404
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,770
Brian.

405
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:58,738
What's going on?
You look lost.

406
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,067
I'm not lost.
I'm just under the gun.

407
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:01,679
Have you seen Katrina?
- No, why?

408
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,213
Bigelow Textiles
is in the conference room

409
00:15:03,215 --> 00:15:06,016
and the meeting was scheduled
for five minutes ago.

410
00:15:06,018 --> 00:15:07,551
I don't know what to do.
- Easy.

411
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:09,753
Katrina's never missed
a meeting in her life.

412
00:15:09,755 --> 00:15:10,954
If she's not there,
she will be.

413
00:15:10,956 --> 00:15:11,755
Just go ahead and start.
- Thing is, I just got

414
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:12,756
the case an hour ago.

415
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:15,759
I'm hazy on the particulars
at best.

416
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:17,327
I think I should cancel.
- I don't think

417
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:18,629
that's a good idea.
- But what happens

418
00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:20,511
if I start the meeting
and she doesn't show up at all?

419
00:15:20,535 --> 00:15:22,152
And what happens
when you cancel the meeting

420
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:23,359
and she shows up
three minutes later?

421
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,930
- Donna--
- Brian, look.

422
00:15:26,044 --> 00:15:28,111
I know your value,
and I believe

423
00:15:28,113 --> 00:15:30,246
that Katrina knows your value,
but the truth is,

424
00:15:30,248 --> 00:15:32,282
not too long ago,
you were on the chopping block.

425
00:15:32,284 --> 00:15:34,417
If you've been invited in
on this case,

426
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:35,785
you're being offered
another chance.

427
00:15:35,787 --> 00:15:37,420
And canceling a meeting
that Katrina's running

428
00:15:37,422 --> 00:15:39,956
a little late to isn't the way
to prove myself.

429
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,125
No, it's not.

430
00:15:43,895 --> 00:15:45,728
You're right.

431
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,264
I'll get it going.

432
00:15:51,403 --> 00:15:52,669
Harvey.

433
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:54,916
Is there a reason
why the 49th floor toilets

434
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:56,839
have been backed up?
- Why would I know that?

435
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,772
Because when I called
to have it fixed, they said

436
00:15:58,773 --> 00:16:00,292
they couldn't get to it
for another four hours

437
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,274
and in the mean time,
maybe you could

438
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:04,008
take a look at it.

439
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,439
Son of a bitch.

440
00:16:07,213 --> 00:16:09,647
You, you, you.

441
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:11,115
Drop what you're doing
and meet me

442
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:12,416
in the conference room.
- We're working on something...

443
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:13,417
I don't give a shit
what you're working on.

444
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:18,088
Conference room, five minutes.

445
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,723
Harvey.

446
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:20,925
Donna, I'm in the middle
of something.

447
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:22,893
I can see that.
Do you mind telling me

448
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:25,193
what that something has to do
with those toilets?

449
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:29,096
It has to do with the fact
that David Fox wants a fight

450
00:16:29,098 --> 00:16:30,897
and I'm gonna give him one.
- A fight about what?

451
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:32,937
He doesn't want to pay
our cleaning woman overtime.

452
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:35,505
Hang on, so you're pulling
the associates

453
00:16:35,507 --> 00:16:36,840
off the Vistech merger
to help her?

454
00:16:36,842 --> 00:16:38,141
Fine, you want me to use
different associates?

455
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,442
I will.
- I don't care

456
00:16:39,444 --> 00:16:42,145
what associates you're using;
I want to explain to you

457
00:16:42,147 --> 00:16:43,480
that David Fox is no joke.

458
00:16:43,482 --> 00:16:45,682
And as noble as it sounds,
you don't want

459
00:16:45,684 --> 00:16:47,918
to get in a fight with him
over something like this.

460
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,353
I know that, Donna.
That's what I said to Zane.

461
00:16:50,355 --> 00:16:52,856
- But...
- But what?

462
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:55,625
Harvey, this isn't what we do.
- Mike would have done it.

463
00:16:55,627 --> 00:16:57,494
And Mike's not here anymore
because he finally came

464
00:16:57,496 --> 00:17:00,830
came to terms with the fact
that this isn't what we do.

465
00:17:00,832 --> 00:17:03,767
Look, if you told Zane
you knew this wasn't worth it,

466
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:06,436
then you already know
I'm right.

467
00:17:08,206 --> 00:17:09,606
Okay, Donna.
You're right.

468
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:11,875
Tell those associates
to get back to whatever

469
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:14,444
they were working on.

470
00:17:19,718 --> 00:17:22,786
Mr. Bigelow, nice to meet you.

471
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:24,020
I'm sorry we're running
a little late.

472
00:17:24,022 --> 00:17:25,555
I'm Brian Altman.
- Where the hell's Katrina?

473
00:17:25,557 --> 00:17:26,890
I'm sure
she'll be right here.

474
00:17:26,892 --> 00:17:28,024
In the mean time,
can I offer you--

475
00:17:28,026 --> 00:17:30,493
No, no, no.
I don't have time

476
00:17:30,495 --> 00:17:32,095
for the meantime.

477
00:17:32,097 --> 00:17:33,196
If Ms. Bennett can't bother
showing up on time,

478
00:17:33,198 --> 00:17:35,532
she can play catch-up
when she gets here.

479
00:17:35,534 --> 00:17:37,000
Okay, I see you're
in a hurry.

480
00:17:37,002 --> 00:17:38,335
Let's go through the report
from the top.

481
00:17:38,337 --> 00:17:41,404
I don't need you
to read me the damn report.

482
00:17:41,406 --> 00:17:45,075
What I need are some answers.

483
00:17:45,077 --> 00:17:47,577
Um, all right.
What do you want to know?

484
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:49,079
What kind of exposure
are we looking at, here?

485
00:17:49,081 --> 00:17:51,581
Well, Kineserve claims
you improperly broke

486
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,883
your contract,
but the board minutes

487
00:17:53,885 --> 00:17:55,352
don't indicate any bad faith
on your part.

488
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:58,054
That's the good news.
- And the bad news?

489
00:17:58,056 --> 00:18:00,457
The minutes don't show
any discussion of good cause

490
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:02,292
for terminating
the contract, either.

491
00:18:02,294 --> 00:18:03,326
No good cause?

492
00:18:03,328 --> 00:18:06,629
Did you see
the delivery manifests?

493
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:08,098
Um, I'd have to take
another look at them

494
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,566
before weighing in.
- Another look?

495
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:14,237
What about
the stress test results?

496
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:15,538
Right.

497
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,940
Let me just find that.
- You haven't even read

498
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:18,308
all the goddamn minutes,
have you?

499
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,411
I must have
just missed that part.

500
00:18:21,413 --> 00:18:22,379
If you'd just let me find it...

501
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:23,613
I can see
what's going on, here.

502
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,181
Katrina didn't think
I was worthy of her attention,

503
00:18:25,183 --> 00:18:26,683
so she pawned me off
on some incompetent,

504
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:30,620
second-rate associate.
- Mr. Bigelow, I can assure you

505
00:18:30,622 --> 00:18:31,788
that is not the case.

506
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,990
Katrina values your business
very much,

507
00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:35,658
and I am
a fully capable attorney.

508
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,127
Not from what I see.

509
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:38,795
And if I can't be handled
by a competent attorney,

510
00:18:38,797 --> 00:18:41,464
I don't see why I should
be handled by this firm at all.

511
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:43,433
Please, Mr. Bigelow.

512
00:18:43,435 --> 00:18:44,968
Um, if we could just reset,
I think we got off

513
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,302
on the wrong foot.
- You wanna reset?

514
00:18:46,304 --> 00:18:48,938
Get your shit together,
'cause I'm not about

515
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,140
to sit here and watch you
bumble your way

516
00:18:50,142 --> 00:18:51,508
through something you're
clearly not prepared for.

517
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,675
And the next time
you call me in for a meeting

518
00:18:52,677 --> 00:18:55,211
without Katrina Bennett,
don't bother

519
00:18:55,213 --> 00:18:57,213
calling me in at all.

520
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:08,576
I don't believe this.

521
00:19:08,944 --> 00:19:10,177
- Brian...
- No, you sent me in

522
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:12,780
to a meeting by myself,
and you're, what?

523
00:19:12,782 --> 00:19:14,448
Out taking a stroll
around the park?

524
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,150
- Please, not now.
- Yes, now, because I just got

525
00:19:16,152 --> 00:19:18,018
my ass handed to me
by your client.

526
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,753
I wasn't taking a stroll;
I was in the bathroom

527
00:19:19,755 --> 00:19:21,522
in a stall
because it's the only place

528
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:25,092
in this entire building
that's dark and quiet.

529
00:19:25,094 --> 00:19:27,027
- What are you talking about?
- I had a migraine.

530
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:28,796
One of the worst I've ever had.

531
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:30,431
And when it was time
for the meeting

532
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:31,565
I opened the door,
but even with the sunglasses

533
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,934
the light made it feel
like there were icicles

534
00:19:33,936 --> 00:19:36,937
in my head,
and I couldn't leave.

535
00:19:36,939 --> 00:19:39,673
Brian, I'm so sorry.

536
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:41,442
I had no idea
you get migraines.

537
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:43,544
I haven't had one
since high school.

538
00:19:43,546 --> 00:19:46,213
They're triggered by stress.
- You mean like the stress

539
00:19:46,215 --> 00:19:47,781
of having to fire
a bunch of associates.

540
00:19:47,783 --> 00:19:50,617
They started the day after.

541
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:52,252
- You need to tell Louis.
- No.

542
00:19:52,254 --> 00:19:53,687
Louis is the last person
who can know about this.

543
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:55,389
Why would you want
to hide this from him?

544
00:19:55,391 --> 00:19:57,024
Because you don't get
nine shots at senior partner;

545
00:19:57,026 --> 00:19:59,059
you get one.

546
00:19:59,061 --> 00:20:01,662
You're up
for senior partner.

547
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:03,197
I am.

548
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,766
No one is supposed to know
about this, not even me.

549
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:07,701
And if suddenly I start
getting migraines

550
00:20:07,703 --> 00:20:10,003
that make it seem
like I can't handle the job...

551
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:13,373
No one's gonna find out
anything from me.

552
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,809
But Bigelow is pretty pissed.
- Well, Bigelow isn't going

553
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:17,344
to be at the motion
to dismiss tomorrow,

554
00:20:17,346 --> 00:20:20,714
so as long as I win that,
we'll be fine.

555
00:20:20,716 --> 00:20:23,584
In the meantime, I'd better
go face the music with Louis.

556
00:20:23,586 --> 00:20:24,985
Brian, you don't have
to do that.

557
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:26,320
If I don't,
he's gonna find out

558
00:20:26,322 --> 00:20:28,689
about your migraines.

559
00:20:28,691 --> 00:20:30,524
Be direct.

560
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:32,092
Tell him you're sorry.

561
00:20:32,094 --> 00:20:37,097
He might not be happy,
but he'll respect you.

562
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:38,499
Brian.

563
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:40,000
If ever there were any doubt

564
00:20:40,002 --> 00:20:42,503
about you being
a valuable associate...

565
00:20:42,505 --> 00:20:44,338
there isn't anymore.

566
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:49,009
- Anna, it's Harvey Specter.
<i>- Mr. Specter.</i>

567
00:20:49,011 --> 00:20:50,744
<i>I didn't expect</i>
<i>to hear from you so soon.</i>

568
00:20:50,746 --> 00:20:51,845
<i>Does this mean that--</i>
- I'm afraid

569
00:20:51,847 --> 00:20:54,948
it's not gonna work.
- What?

570
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,918
<i>I tried talking to them,</i>
<i>and there's nothing I can do.</i>

571
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,419
You mean you don't want
to make a problem

572
00:20:59,421 --> 00:21:01,522
for your firm.
<i>- No.</i>

573
00:21:01,524 --> 00:21:03,323
Anna...

574
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:05,259
there's another firm out there
I can recommend to you.

575
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:07,761
I can't afford
to pay another firm.

576
00:21:07,763 --> 00:21:09,029
<i>You wouldn't have to.</i>

577
00:21:09,031 --> 00:21:11,598
Look, the guy who used
to do cases like this

578
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,667
doesn't work here anymore,
but he used to work

579
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:15,869
at a clinic, and I'm talking
about setting you up there.

580
00:21:15,871 --> 00:21:17,204
<i>I should have known</i>

581
00:21:17,206 --> 00:21:19,640
<i>you'd pawn me off.</i>
- I'm not pawning you off.

582
00:21:19,642 --> 00:21:22,342
I promise, I will go down there
and make sure one

583
00:21:22,344 --> 00:21:26,146
of the two lawyers I know
handles this personally.

584
00:21:26,148 --> 00:21:27,581
Okay.

585
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,951
If you trust this firm,
then I trust you.

586
00:21:30,953 --> 00:21:33,287
I'll be in touch.

587
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:41,128
Yes, absolutely.

588
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,864
I agree 100%.

589
00:21:45,634 --> 00:21:49,236
Never again.

590
00:21:49,238 --> 00:21:50,437
Hey, Louis, can I talk
to you for a second?

591
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,538
Sure as hell can,
'cause I wanna know

592
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,841
what the ---- happened
in that meeting.

593
00:21:53,843 --> 00:21:55,075
- That's what I came--
- You know what, never mind.

594
00:21:55,077 --> 00:21:56,143
I don't need to hear it,
because I just got

595
00:21:56,145 --> 00:21:58,245
off the phone
with John Bigelow,

596
00:21:58,247 --> 00:21:59,580
and he tells me
that you couldn't answer

597
00:21:59,582 --> 00:22:02,049
a goddamn question.
- I know that, and I just--

598
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:03,884
He also says, and I quote,
"I never want

599
00:22:03,886 --> 00:22:08,021
to be in another meeting
with Brian Altman again."

600
00:22:08,023 --> 00:22:09,656
I--I'm sorry, Louis.
I'm sorry.

601
00:22:09,658 --> 00:22:10,791
You're sorry?

602
00:22:10,793 --> 00:22:11,992
That's all you have
to say for yourself?

603
00:22:11,994 --> 00:22:14,494
Because you just
let down Katrina.

604
00:22:14,496 --> 00:22:16,363
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

605
00:22:16,365 --> 00:22:18,866
- I do.
- I do not think that you do.

606
00:22:18,868 --> 00:22:21,835
Because she wanted to fire you,
Brian, and I wouldn't let her.

607
00:22:21,837 --> 00:22:23,270
Then she gives you
a second chance,

608
00:22:23,272 --> 00:22:24,905
and you do this?

609
00:22:24,907 --> 00:22:27,541
What the hell is your excuse,
Brian?

610
00:22:27,543 --> 00:22:30,010
Do you just suck at your job,
or are you actively trying

611
00:22:30,012 --> 00:22:32,713
to undermine
a direct supervisor?

612
00:22:32,715 --> 00:22:34,915
- I guess I suck at my job.
- Something like this

613
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:37,017
ever happens again,
forget about being fired.

614
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:38,585
You're gonna wish
you were never born.

615
00:22:38,587 --> 00:22:41,788
Now get out, because right now
John Bigelow isn't the only one

616
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:44,858
who never wants
to see your face again.

617
00:23:01,543 --> 00:23:04,945
Hi, can I help you?

618
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:06,213
Is Nathan Krueger here?

619
00:23:06,215 --> 00:23:09,016
Nathan's in Philadelphia
on a case.

620
00:23:09,018 --> 00:23:11,752
- How about Oliver Grady?
- Oliver's out with a client.

621
00:23:11,754 --> 00:23:13,720
Is there something
I can help you with?

622
00:23:13,722 --> 00:23:15,389
No, thanks.

623
00:23:15,391 --> 00:23:17,724
Can I tell them
who stopped by?

624
00:23:17,726 --> 00:23:20,661
It's okay; I've taken enough
of your time.

625
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:29,169
- Is that what I think it is?
- Renoir.

626
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:31,438
Signed, sealed, and delivered.

627
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,606
Mind telling me
how you pulled it off?

628
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,741
Absolutely, as soon
as you hand me

629
00:23:34,743 --> 00:23:36,343
a signed engagement letter.

630
00:23:36,345 --> 00:23:37,544
You know what,
I'm gonna do you one better.

631
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:39,112
Why don't you take out
your phone and check out

632
00:23:39,114 --> 00:23:40,514
the latest edition
of the "Journal."

633
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,320
I don't believe it.

634
00:23:46,322 --> 00:23:47,321
You issued an announcement

635
00:23:47,323 --> 00:23:48,989
saying we're
your new attorneys.

636
00:23:48,991 --> 00:23:50,290
I told you, you're my guy,
and I don't mind

637
00:23:50,292 --> 00:23:52,526
the world knowing it.

638
00:23:52,528 --> 00:23:55,762
- So where do you want this?
- I don't give a shit,

639
00:23:55,764 --> 00:23:57,798
'cause it's not
gonna be here long.

640
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,666
What?

641
00:23:59,668 --> 00:24:00,734
I'm shipping it
to the Cayman Islands

642
00:24:00,736 --> 00:24:01,868
where a certain
airline company's

643
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:05,372
gonna pay me $55 million
for it.

644
00:24:05,374 --> 00:24:06,940
I thought you said
it was only worth 16,

645
00:24:06,942 --> 00:24:08,041
and that you'd never sell it.

646
00:24:08,043 --> 00:24:10,043
Well, that's the thing
about art:

647
00:24:10,045 --> 00:24:12,846
the value is in the eye
of the beholder.

648
00:24:12,848 --> 00:24:15,916
I want you to behold this.

649
00:24:18,153 --> 00:24:20,620
You want me on-shore
55 million from a blind trust

650
00:24:20,622 --> 00:24:21,922
in the Caymans?

651
00:24:21,924 --> 00:24:23,991
Gavin, I have to tell you,
this looks a hell of lot

652
00:24:23,993 --> 00:24:25,492
like laundering money.
- Well, then it's a good thing

653
00:24:25,494 --> 00:24:27,561
you don't know that for sure,
because if you don't know it

654
00:24:27,563 --> 00:24:30,464
you can do it,
and you're going to do it.

655
00:24:30,466 --> 00:24:31,698
I get it.

656
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,800
You gave me a bullshit story
about this thing

657
00:24:33,802 --> 00:24:35,502
having sentimental value
to rope me in.

658
00:24:35,504 --> 00:24:37,037
then you put out
an announcement saying

659
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:37,938
we're your attorneys.

660
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,674
And now, if I don't do this,

661
00:24:40,676 --> 00:24:41,708
you drop us
and the world thinks

662
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,643
we shit the bed
inside of a day.

663
00:24:43,645 --> 00:24:45,345
You catch on quick.

664
00:24:45,347 --> 00:24:47,381
- I'm not doing it.
- Maybe you will,

665
00:24:47,383 --> 00:24:49,383
maybe you won't.

666
00:24:49,385 --> 00:24:50,717
But you'd better think about
how you're gonna explain

667
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:53,353
to Robert Zane
how you signed me and lost me

668
00:24:53,355 --> 00:24:55,922
inside of two days.

669
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,420
There you are.
I've been waiting for you

670
00:25:08,421 --> 00:25:09,887
to give me something to do.

671
00:25:09,889 --> 00:25:12,122
There isn't much left to do,
so I'm handling it myself.

672
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:15,292
Katrina, come on,
there's a ton of work left.

673
00:25:16,128 --> 00:25:17,294
I can see you're still in pain.

674
00:25:17,296 --> 00:25:18,095
There must be something
I can do.

675
00:25:18,097 --> 00:25:19,363
I'll be fine.

676
00:25:19,365 --> 00:25:21,665
What if I turned
all the lights on?

677
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:23,700
Would you be fine then?

678
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:25,202
Katrina, 'cause that's
what it's gonna be like

679
00:25:25,204 --> 00:25:28,205
in court tomorrow.
- Brian.

680
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:30,607
I heard what happened
with Louis,

681
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:33,677
and I'm not going
to let that happen again.

682
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,417
Listen to me.

683
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:42,319
I knew what I signed up for
when I said I'd keep

684
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:45,489
your situation a secret.
- And I appreciate it.

685
00:25:45,491 --> 00:25:47,224
And now I'm going
to go into court tomorrow

686
00:25:47,226 --> 00:25:48,325
and do the best I can.

687
00:25:48,327 --> 00:25:50,127
Katrina, you gave me
a second chance,

688
00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:53,097
and when you did,
you admitted you were wrong.

689
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,266
Not everyone would do that.

690
00:25:56,268 --> 00:25:58,569
And someone that would
is exactly the kind of person

691
00:25:58,571 --> 00:26:01,238
I want to have leading me
as a senior partner.

692
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,273
So if you won't let me
do this for you,

693
00:26:03,275 --> 00:26:05,409
at least let's do it together.

694
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:09,947
Okay, Brian.
We'll do it together.

695
00:26:12,418 --> 00:26:14,418
Alex, whatever it is,
I'm meeting a client

696
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,452
for dinner.
- That's okay,

697
00:26:15,454 --> 00:26:16,687
I just have one question.

698
00:26:16,689 --> 00:26:17,921
Did you know?
- Know what?

699
00:26:17,923 --> 00:26:19,323
That Gavin Andrews
was gonna ask me

700
00:26:19,325 --> 00:26:21,992
to launder money for him.

701
00:26:21,994 --> 00:26:24,294
I don't believe it.
You knew it the whole time.

702
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:25,863
No, I didn't.

703
00:26:25,865 --> 00:26:27,698
But I knew he was gonna
ask you to do something.

704
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,433
Then you and I
are gonna go upstairs

705
00:26:29,435 --> 00:26:30,834
and figure out how
to get out of this, right now.

706
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:32,503
Are you out of your mind?

707
00:26:32,505 --> 00:26:34,138
I'm not going anywhere near
that man's account.

708
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,273
Yes, you are,
because you knew my history

709
00:26:36,275 --> 00:26:38,075
and you let me
sign him anyway.

710
00:26:38,077 --> 00:26:40,144
Are you fucking kidding me?
I brought up your history.

711
00:26:40,146 --> 00:26:42,112
And you knew I was
in no position to trust you.

712
00:26:42,114 --> 00:26:43,313
And what I was I supposed
to do about that?

713
00:26:43,315 --> 00:26:45,682
You could have given me
some goddamn specifics.

714
00:26:45,684 --> 00:26:47,351
'Cause there's no way
you didn't have something

715
00:26:47,353 --> 00:26:48,986
that would have convinced me
you were telling the truth.

716
00:26:48,988 --> 00:26:50,687
And how was I supposed
to trust you wouldn't use

717
00:26:50,689 --> 00:26:52,356
whatever I said against me?
- I wouldn't do that.

718
00:26:52,358 --> 00:26:53,724
Oh?
So if I had said,

719
00:26:53,726 --> 00:26:55,359
"Hey, Alex,
don't sign this guy.

720
00:26:55,361 --> 00:26:56,360
He's gonna ask you
to cover up a murder."

721
00:26:56,362 --> 00:26:57,327
You weren't gonna use that?

722
00:26:57,329 --> 00:26:59,062
Is that what he asked you
to do?

723
00:26:59,064 --> 00:27:00,631
This conversation is over.

724
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:02,533
You made your bed.
Don't come crying to me

725
00:27:02,535 --> 00:27:05,068
because the sheets are dirty.
- I'm not gonna cry to anyone.

726
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,870
I'm gonna tell Zane
exactly what this man

727
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:08,472
is all about,
and we'll see what happens

728
00:27:08,474 --> 00:27:10,307
when he finds out
whatever shit you did.

729
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:14,178
You don't think Robert knew?

730
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,512
Why do you think
he didn't fight

731
00:27:15,514 --> 00:27:18,849
for Gavin's business
when we left Rand Kaldor?

732
00:27:18,851 --> 00:27:21,318
You're saying Zane knows
you did illegal shit?

733
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,254
I'm saying, Robert Zane knew
what kind of a client

734
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:26,990
Gavin Andrews was,
that I knew how to handle him,

735
00:27:26,992 --> 00:27:29,693
and that I stopped wanting to.

736
00:27:29,695 --> 00:27:32,896
Then help me get out of this.

737
00:27:32,898 --> 00:27:34,565
- Why should I?
- Because we're on

738
00:27:34,567 --> 00:27:36,567
the same team,
and that's supposed

739
00:27:36,569 --> 00:27:38,502
to mean something,
especially when it's about

740
00:27:38,504 --> 00:27:40,037
breaking the law.

741
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:41,672
Please, Samantha.

742
00:27:41,674 --> 00:27:44,608
I should have listened to you,
but I have a family.

743
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,911
I can't afford to do something
that'll hurt them.

744
00:27:47,913 --> 00:27:51,215
Okay, Alex.

745
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:54,184
You are a family man.

746
00:27:54,186 --> 00:27:57,421
He is not.
- What are you saying?

747
00:27:57,423 --> 00:27:59,856
I'm saying,
you're the kind of man

748
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:02,859
that would go to any length
to protect your family.

749
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:04,695
Gavin Andrews
is the kind of man

750
00:28:04,697 --> 00:28:09,366
that would go to any length
to protect himself.

751
00:28:12,338 --> 00:28:15,105
So all we need to do
is open with material breach,

752
00:28:15,107 --> 00:28:17,407
show severability
doesn't apply, then close

753
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:19,409
with impossibility
of performance.

754
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:20,911
We do all that,
it'll drive the stake

755
00:28:20,913 --> 00:28:23,313
right through their claim.

756
00:28:23,315 --> 00:28:25,582
We?

757
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:27,284
Yes, we.

758
00:28:27,286 --> 00:28:28,819
Because although
I'm feeling better,

759
00:28:28,821 --> 00:28:30,053
you did this as much as I did,
which means

760
00:28:30,055 --> 00:28:32,489
we should do it together.

761
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:34,491
You sure?

762
00:28:34,493 --> 00:28:36,593
I'm sure.

763
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:37,661
I do believe
that's the first time

764
00:28:37,663 --> 00:28:38,829
I've seen you smile
since we started

765
00:28:38,831 --> 00:28:41,431
this whole thing.

766
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:43,166
I was just thinking
about my senior year

767
00:28:43,168 --> 00:28:44,301
of high school.

768
00:28:44,303 --> 00:28:45,502
This is how I used
to do my homework.

769
00:28:45,504 --> 00:28:47,504
You had an associate
write your papers for you

770
00:28:47,506 --> 00:28:50,941
in high school?
- I had a study partner.

771
00:28:50,943 --> 00:28:53,343
He was my best friend.

772
00:28:53,345 --> 00:28:56,113
We used to write our papers
together by flash light.

773
00:28:56,115 --> 00:28:59,583
Never thought I'd be doing
the same thing years later.

774
00:28:59,585 --> 00:29:02,152
You in touch with him?

775
00:29:02,154 --> 00:29:03,954
No.

776
00:29:03,956 --> 00:29:05,656
But I feel like I am
after tonight.

777
00:29:08,594 --> 00:29:10,961
Now you're smiling.
I know it sounds cheesy.

778
00:29:10,963 --> 00:29:13,330
No, I was just thinking
about where we were a week ago

779
00:29:13,332 --> 00:29:16,800
when I thought
you were cold and heartless.

780
00:29:16,802 --> 00:29:19,202
And I went from that
to being your best friend

781
00:29:19,204 --> 00:29:21,038
in record time.
- I wouldn't say best friends.

782
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,739
Well, you can only say stuff
like that to me

783
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:24,941
because we're, like,
best friends.

784
00:29:24,943 --> 00:29:27,344
Well, I don't know
about that.

785
00:29:27,346 --> 00:29:29,513
But we are close enough
for me to tell you

786
00:29:29,515 --> 00:29:30,981
that you're going
to go to court

787
00:29:30,983 --> 00:29:32,516
by yourself tomorrow.

788
00:29:32,518 --> 00:29:34,685
But I thought you said
you were feeling better.

789
00:29:34,687 --> 00:29:37,554
I am, but you did all this
to help prove

790
00:29:37,556 --> 00:29:38,889
that I could manage people,

791
00:29:38,891 --> 00:29:40,157
and what kind of manager
would I be

792
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,795
if I didn't give you a chance
to prove yourself

793
00:29:41,796 --> 00:29:44,261
to John Bigelow?

794
00:29:44,263 --> 00:29:46,496
You sure?

795
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:49,466
I'm sure.

796
00:29:55,741 --> 00:29:57,307
What do you mean
you gotta go down to Central?

797
00:29:57,309 --> 00:29:58,709
How long's that gonna take?
- It's gonna take

798
00:29:58,711 --> 00:29:59,876
as long as it takes.
- What the hell

799
00:29:59,878 --> 00:30:01,211
is going on, here?
- Robert, you all right?

800
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:02,446
You look like hell.
- The elevator wouldn't stop

801
00:30:02,448 --> 00:30:03,814
on our floor.

802
00:30:03,816 --> 00:30:06,416
Had to get off at 45 and hike
the rest of the way up here.

803
00:30:06,418 --> 00:30:08,218
God damn, man,
you gotta keep in shape.

804
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,653
That was only five floors.
- Is that really the problem

805
00:30:09,655 --> 00:30:11,054
we need to talk about, Louis?
- No.

806
00:30:11,056 --> 00:30:12,389
In fact, an hour ago,
the elevators

807
00:30:12,391 --> 00:30:13,957
weren't working at all.
- Shit.

808
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:15,225
And now this ass clown says
that he needs

809
00:30:15,227 --> 00:30:17,394
to have landlord's approval
to order a simple fuse.

810
00:30:17,396 --> 00:30:18,929
- What?
- I said that he's--

811
00:30:18,931 --> 00:30:20,764
I know what you said.
I wanna hear it from him.

812
00:30:20,766 --> 00:30:22,099
What do you want me to say?

813
00:30:22,101 --> 00:30:23,767
I got orders
from my supervisor.

814
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:25,869
No new parts without Mr. Fox's
specific approval.

815
00:30:25,871 --> 00:30:27,371
Louis, I know
what's going on here.

816
00:30:27,373 --> 00:30:29,373
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about the fact

817
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:31,942
that this is
no goddamn coincidence.

818
00:30:35,414 --> 00:30:36,580
Anna, it's Harvey Specter.

819
00:30:36,582 --> 00:30:37,948
I've got good news:
I've decided

820
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,284
<i>to take care of you myself.</i>

821
00:30:41,286 --> 00:30:42,919
Because I showed up
to work this morning

822
00:30:42,921 --> 00:30:46,490
and they told me I was fired,
and that I shouldn't bother

823
00:30:46,492 --> 00:30:48,225
<i>applying to any...</i>
- Anna, I got something

824
00:30:48,227 --> 00:30:49,593
I can't reschedule
right this second.

825
00:30:49,595 --> 00:30:51,027
I'm gonna have to--
<i>- Please, Mr. Specter.</i>

826
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:53,897
<i>I was in horrible shape</i>
<i>before, but now I don't know</i>

827
00:30:53,899 --> 00:30:55,165
<i>what to do.</i>
- Look, I'll tell you

828
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:56,700
what we're gonna do:
I'm gonna call you back

829
00:30:56,702 --> 00:30:57,934
in five minutes, you're gonna
tell me exactly what happened.

830
00:30:57,936 --> 00:31:01,505
because I'm not gonna let them
get away with this.

831
00:31:01,507 --> 00:31:02,739
Okay, Harvey,
what the hell is going on

832
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:04,174
with that cleaning woman?
- Robert...

833
00:31:04,176 --> 00:31:05,342
You said you weren't going
to pick a fight, and you did.

834
00:31:05,344 --> 00:31:07,978
And now our elevators
aren't working.

835
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,346
You wanna know
what's going on?

836
00:31:09,348 --> 00:31:12,649
David Fox just retaliated
against Anna by firing her,

837
00:31:12,651 --> 00:31:14,684
and I'm about
to knock his teeth out.

838
00:31:14,686 --> 00:31:16,820
- You will do no such thing.
- Relax, Robert.

839
00:31:16,822 --> 00:31:18,522
We can handle
a clogged toilet or two.

840
00:31:18,524 --> 00:31:20,123
Did you hear
what I just said?

841
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,091
I'm not talking about toilets.

842
00:31:21,093 --> 00:31:23,026
The man just shut down
our elevators,

843
00:31:23,028 --> 00:31:24,594
and I'm not gonna let us
start losing clients

844
00:31:24,596 --> 00:31:26,163
because you decided
the cleaning staff

845
00:31:26,165 --> 00:31:27,531
is more important
than the needs of this firm.

846
00:31:27,533 --> 00:31:29,966
I didn't do anything
that you didn't sign off on.

847
00:31:29,968 --> 00:31:31,501
Bullshit.
You said that you were

848
00:31:31,503 --> 00:31:32,636
gonna have
a two-minute conversation

849
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:34,271
with the man,
and if that's all you did

850
00:31:34,273 --> 00:31:35,672
he wouldn't be sabotaging
our offices.

851
00:31:35,674 --> 00:31:37,274
Well, you know what, Robert?
I don't care

852
00:31:37,276 --> 00:31:39,810
what he's doing to us.
I care what he's doing to her.

853
00:31:39,812 --> 00:31:41,611
- What did you just say?
- I said I don't care

854
00:31:41,613 --> 00:31:42,846
what he's doing to us.
- Well, I do.

855
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,148
- Excuse me?
- You heard me, Harvey.

856
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,450
I don't know what it is
you think you're doing,

857
00:31:46,452 --> 00:31:48,618
but it needs to stop.
- I don't believe this.

858
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,520
You're siding with him.
- Yes, Harvey, I am.

859
00:31:50,522 --> 00:31:51,955
And you're not gonna want
to hear this either, Harvey,

860
00:31:51,957 --> 00:31:53,023
but I am too.

861
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:54,324
Because if you keep
escalating this,

862
00:31:54,326 --> 00:31:55,759
it's not just gonna be
about broken elevators.

863
00:31:55,761 --> 00:31:56,960
He's gonna find a way
to kick us out of the building.

864
00:31:56,962 --> 00:31:58,295
Well, none of you
are gonna want to hear this,

865
00:31:58,297 --> 00:32:01,965
but I don't give a shit
whether he kicks us out

866
00:32:01,967 --> 00:32:03,033
of the building or not.
- That's enough.

867
00:32:03,035 --> 00:32:04,267
You don't go to war
with the guy

868
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:06,636
that owns your house
over something like this.

869
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:10,207
End it, and end it today.

870
00:32:19,047 --> 00:32:20,579
May I join you?

871
00:32:20,884 --> 00:32:22,641
You don't usually ask that.

872
00:32:22,642 --> 00:32:23,875
And you haven't made
your own copies

873
00:32:23,877 --> 00:32:26,277
since we were at
the DA's office.

874
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,912
I guess I haven't.

875
00:32:31,484 --> 00:32:32,984
Harvey, I thought
that you were gonna

876
00:32:32,986 --> 00:32:34,786
take this thing to the clinic.

877
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:36,654
That's what I did, Donna.

878
00:32:36,656 --> 00:32:38,856
But Nathan and Oliver
weren't there;

879
00:32:38,858 --> 00:32:40,725
there were cases piled high
on every desk;

880
00:32:40,727 --> 00:32:42,560
and nobody there
would care about her

881
00:32:42,562 --> 00:32:44,529
the way I needed them to, so...

882
00:32:44,531 --> 00:32:46,731
I turned around
and I walked right out.

883
00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:49,701
- I see.
- How did I get here, Donna?

884
00:32:49,703 --> 00:32:52,537
I'm at odds with Robert
and Louis, and now even you,

885
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:55,406
over something two months ago
shouldn't have even shown up

886
00:32:55,408 --> 00:32:56,407
on my radar.

887
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:59,043
I'll tell you
how you got here...

888
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:00,144
and I can't believe
I didn't see this

889
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:02,480
the second you started
this thing.

890
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:05,049
Harvey, you're missing Mike.

891
00:33:05,051 --> 00:33:06,584
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you see?

892
00:33:06,586 --> 00:33:08,920
This case has Mike Ross
written all over it.

893
00:33:08,922 --> 00:33:09,987
And you didn't walk out
of that clinic

894
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:11,122
because Nathan and Oliver
weren't there;

895
00:33:11,124 --> 00:33:12,423
you walked out
because Mike wasn't there.

896
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:15,093
Well, what am I supposed
to do about that, Donna?

897
00:33:15,095 --> 00:33:17,662
Because this woman needs help,
and I am not gonna throw her

898
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:20,264
out on the street.
- Tell you what I'd do.

899
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:21,466
I'd call Mike.

900
00:33:21,468 --> 00:33:23,234
If there's anyone who's been
in a situation

901
00:33:23,236 --> 00:33:24,602
like this before, it's him,

902
00:33:24,604 --> 00:33:27,572
and he's the best person
to figure a way out.

903
00:33:27,574 --> 00:33:29,340
But Harvey, you've got
to do it soon,

904
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:31,743
because Robert and Louis
are right.

905
00:33:31,745 --> 00:33:35,413
You have to let this thing go.

906
00:33:43,123 --> 00:33:45,022
- Is it done?
- It is done.

907
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:46,190
Good.

908
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:50,762
Wasn't so hard, was it?
- Not for me.

909
00:33:50,764 --> 00:33:52,430
What's this?

910
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:53,798
The hell did you do
with my money?

911
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,200
I found you a legitimate
business opportunity.

912
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:57,335
In the goddamn
Cayman Islands?

913
00:33:57,337 --> 00:33:58,703
Funny thing:
most people want

914
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:01,439
to repatriate their money,
which means you can make

915
00:34:01,441 --> 00:34:03,708
a pretty sweet deal
by investing locally instead.

916
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,110
You can't do this.
You don't have the authority.

917
00:34:06,112 --> 00:34:07,078
I do now,
because you're looking

918
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,547
at the new trustee
of your account.

919
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:11,616
- That's impossible.
- Is it?

920
00:34:11,618 --> 00:34:13,217
Pretty smart
making your niece trustee

921
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,285
to insulate yourself.

922
00:34:14,287 --> 00:34:15,720
Of course, when I told her
you set her up

923
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:16,988
to take the fall
if authorities ever found out

924
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,356
where your money came from,
she was more than happy

925
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:22,326
to sign over control to me.
- I don't believe you.

926
00:34:22,328 --> 00:34:24,228
Pick up the phone
and call her.

927
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,363
She's kind of pissed
at you, though.

928
00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:27,598
Thanksgiving might be
weird this year.

929
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,667
You son of a bitch.
You sold me out.

930
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:31,636
No, Gavin, I didn't.

931
00:34:31,638 --> 00:34:33,771
I did what's in
your best interest,

932
00:34:33,773 --> 00:34:35,506
regardless of the fact
that you're too stupid

933
00:34:35,508 --> 00:34:36,741
to see it.

934
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:39,143
- You're fired.
- I don't think so.

935
00:34:39,145 --> 00:34:40,378
Because if I can do this
to you,

936
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,747
imagine what I can do
for you.

937
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:45,449
But if you ever ask me
to do anything like this

938
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:47,985
ever again,
I won't just turn you in.

939
00:34:47,987 --> 00:34:50,755
I'll sign over every nickel
of this trust to your niece,

940
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:53,591
and every other relative
you've ever screwed over.

941
00:34:53,593 --> 00:34:56,527
Are we clear?

942
00:34:56,529 --> 00:34:59,430
We're clear.

943
00:35:08,141 --> 00:35:09,540
Louis, can I talk to you
for a minute?

944
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:11,843
Of course.
But first, I understand

945
00:35:11,845 --> 00:35:13,177
congratulations are in order.

946
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:14,946
I heard you won
in court today.

947
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:16,180
That's the thing.

948
00:35:16,182 --> 00:35:19,617
It wasn't me who won, Louis;
it was Brian.

949
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,219
- What?
- Just let me explain.

950
00:35:21,221 --> 00:35:22,653
Explain what?

951
00:35:22,655 --> 00:35:23,788
That the client said "no Brian"
and you didn't listen?

952
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,022
I don't care
what the client said

953
00:35:25,024 --> 00:35:27,959
because two years ago,
another client said,

954
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:29,093
"no Katrina" and "no Rachel,"

955
00:35:29,095 --> 00:35:31,462
and you told them
to go to hell.

956
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:33,064
So why should I be
any different

957
00:35:33,066 --> 00:35:34,799
as a manager than you?
- Because, Katrina,

958
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:36,500
the situation was different.

959
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:39,237
You didn't shit the bed;
Brian did.

960
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:42,306
No, Louis, he didn't.

961
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:45,176
I did.

962
00:35:45,178 --> 00:35:46,377
What are you talking about?

963
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:49,180
I've been getting migraines,
Louis.

964
00:35:49,182 --> 00:35:52,316
I used to get them as a kid,
and ever since I had

965
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:55,987
to fire those associates,
I started getting them again.

966
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,255
And you were afraid
to tell me

967
00:35:57,257 --> 00:35:59,257
because of senior partner.

968
00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:01,359
Yes, and I was supposed
to be in that meeting

969
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:02,727
with Brian, and he didn't
tell you about it

970
00:36:02,729 --> 00:36:05,863
because he was protecting me.

971
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:10,101
So it wasn't Brian's fault;
it was yours.

972
00:36:10,103 --> 00:36:12,403
It was.

973
00:36:12,405 --> 00:36:14,872
And I know you're gonna have
to tell Robert everything,

974
00:36:14,874 --> 00:36:19,176
and I know that probably means
I won't be senior partner,

975
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:22,513
but I can't let Brian
hurt his career for me.

976
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:26,851
Katrina, the only thing
I'm gonna be telling Robert

977
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:30,554
is that you're gonna make
one hell of a senior partner.

978
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:42,533
- Is that what I think it is?
- If you think it's the plan

979
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:47,738
to put this Fox thing to bed,
then yes.

980
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,242
This is good.

981
00:36:51,244 --> 00:36:53,144
Mike's a pretty smart guy.
- It is good,

982
00:36:53,146 --> 00:36:54,378
but Mike didn't
come up with it.

983
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,646
- I did.
- Well,

984
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:59,617
now that you mention it,
I do see a bunch of flaws.

985
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:02,586
Seriously, Harvey,
this is great, but...

986
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:04,922
why didn't you talk to Mike?

987
00:37:04,924 --> 00:37:07,124
Because I thought instead
of calling and asking

988
00:37:07,126 --> 00:37:10,294
for a solution, I'd rather call
and tell him a story

989
00:37:10,296 --> 00:37:12,330
with a happy ending.
- And you don't send in

990
00:37:12,332 --> 00:37:14,732
the puppy to clean up
the dog's mess.

991
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:17,134
- Something like that.
- In that case,

992
00:37:17,136 --> 00:37:19,904
you're gonna need this back.
- No, I'm not,

993
00:37:19,906 --> 00:37:22,807
because you're gonna be the one
to give it to David Fox.

994
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:25,209
- Why me?
- Because we still need

995
00:37:25,211 --> 00:37:27,578
to get him to agree,
and we can either do it

996
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,081
with a sledgehammer
or a velvet glove.

997
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,749
I get it.

998
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:34,218
You're saying
I'm a sledgehammer.

999
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,288
Something like that.

1000
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,657
Listen, Harvey, if you're
gonna send me in there

1001
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:40,891
to negotiate this,
I need to know

1002
00:37:40,893 --> 00:37:43,094
that I have carte Blanche
to do what it takes

1003
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:46,397
to close him.
- I know.

1004
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:50,301
You do.

1005
00:37:50,303 --> 00:37:51,902
Hey.

1006
00:37:51,904 --> 00:37:54,305
How'd you think of this?

1007
00:37:54,307 --> 00:37:55,439
Easy.

1008
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:59,310
I just thought,
"What would Mike do?"

1009
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,986
Donna Paulsen.

1010
00:38:08,988 --> 00:38:10,855
- David Fox.
- You know, if you're here

1011
00:38:10,857 --> 00:38:12,623
to harass me
about this cleaning lady,

1012
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:15,459
then you can just
turn right around.

1013
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:18,462
I'm here because of this.

1014
00:38:22,535 --> 00:38:24,368
You're filing
a class-action lawsuit?

1015
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,537
We're not;
East Side Legal Clinic is.

1016
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:28,139
Which means that no matter
what you do to us,

1017
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:30,241
it's not going away.

1018
00:38:30,243 --> 00:38:31,809
And if you try
to fire anybody else,

1019
00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:33,277
you'll be getting
another one of those.

1020
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:35,980
And it won't be for overtime;
it'll be for retaliation.

1021
00:38:35,982 --> 00:38:38,816
You'll be in court
for the rest of your life.

1022
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:41,385
Why are you here
instead of Harvey Specter?

1023
00:38:41,387 --> 00:38:44,488
Because if Harvey were here,
he'd drop that down

1024
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,357
walk out,
and go to war with you.

1025
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:49,026
I, on the other hand,
have a compromise.

1026
00:38:49,028 --> 00:38:51,829
- Which is?
- Give Anna Reed her job back,

1027
00:38:51,831 --> 00:38:53,831
you start paying those people
what they're worth...

1028
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:55,866
- And?
- You get free legal services

1029
00:38:55,868 --> 00:38:57,735
from Harvey Specter himself
for the next year.

1030
00:38:57,737 --> 00:38:58,669
Oh, come on.
Bullshit.

1031
00:38:58,671 --> 00:39:00,337
There's no way
he agrees to that.

1032
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:01,539
Oh, he'll agree to it,
all right.

1033
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:03,074
So you mean he doesn't
already know about it.

1034
00:39:03,076 --> 00:39:04,408
No, he doesn't.

1035
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:06,544
But he gave me the authority
to close this thing,

1036
00:39:06,546 --> 00:39:08,345
and that's what I've determined
it's gonna take

1037
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:10,414
because neither one of you
is gonna compromise

1038
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:13,717
unless you know the other one
is getting shafted.

1039
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:15,619
- One condition.
- Nope.

1040
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:17,388
This is take it or leave it.
- You won't even hear

1041
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,823
my condition.
- No, I won't,

1042
00:39:18,825 --> 00:39:19,924
because I have no interest
in going to dinner with you

1043
00:39:19,926 --> 00:39:21,592
to close this deal.

1044
00:39:21,594 --> 00:39:23,561
So what's it gonna be?

1045
00:39:23,563 --> 00:39:27,598
War or win-win?

1046
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,201
You set up the paperwork
in the morning, we got a deal.

1047
00:39:30,203 --> 00:39:31,602
I'll do you one better.

1048
00:39:31,604 --> 00:39:32,803
I'll send it down
in the morning.

1049
00:39:32,805 --> 00:39:35,906
I got better things to do
with my time.

1050
00:39:44,217 --> 00:39:45,549
What's this?

1051
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:49,053
Floor-level tickets
for the UFC at Barclays.

1052
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:51,822
- You did your homework.
- I did.

1053
00:39:51,824 --> 00:39:52,990
Like you told me
I should have done

1054
00:39:52,992 --> 00:39:54,125
with Gavin Andrews
in the first place.

1055
00:39:54,127 --> 00:39:56,393
I assume that means
you took care of him?

1056
00:39:56,395 --> 00:39:58,996
And the horse he rode in on.

1057
00:39:58,998 --> 00:40:01,298
Anyway, I know
we'll probably end up

1058
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,600
going toe-to-toe
plenty of more times

1059
00:40:02,602 --> 00:40:07,805
before it's all over,
but for now, good night.

1060
00:40:07,807 --> 00:40:10,674
You're more than meets the eye.

1061
00:40:10,676 --> 00:40:13,110
Alex.

1062
00:40:13,112 --> 00:40:15,112
I know you think
we're in competition

1063
00:40:15,114 --> 00:40:17,982
for the same thing,
but we're not.

1064
00:40:17,984 --> 00:40:20,351
What are you talking about?

1065
00:40:20,353 --> 00:40:22,920
Robert Zane
made me a promise.

1066
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:27,324
The next name that goes up
on the wall is mine.

1067
00:40:27,326 --> 00:40:29,126
Why are you telling me this?

1068
00:40:29,128 --> 00:40:30,261
Because we're never going
to trust each other

1069
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:32,530
if you think I'm trying
to get ahead of you.

1070
00:40:32,532 --> 00:40:33,531
I'm not.

1071
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:36,800
Because I already am.

1072
00:40:38,971 --> 00:40:43,140
Good night, Samantha.

1073
00:40:43,142 --> 00:40:46,043
Good night.
